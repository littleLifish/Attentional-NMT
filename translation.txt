thank you .
shut twice .
robert gupta .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
this is frightening .
... not yet .
i don &apos;t know .
ban is a bonus .
i was amazed .
i can help .
a lot of them .
yeah . okay .
thank you .
they squirt it .
thank you .
no hospital .
that was incredible .
thank you .
you can go in .
after a week .
i &apos;m tom .
it has sensors .
centers were built .
home ?
we love entertainment .
we love innovation .
or before bombs .
we &apos;re cutting off .
solar technology is ...
this is not ...
a few less .
i created one .
we were poor .
what does that mean ?
what does that mean ?
oh my god !
we are losing them .
are they all ?
sounds good ?
it &apos;s interesting .
we were .
long , yes .
that &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s not an disclosure management .
that &apos;s efficient .
it &apos;s unacceptable .
no one is not going to happen .
the only opportunity .
yes , milliseconds .
yes , so .
music as a language .
fantastic , right ?
yes , hello .
the sun goes .
that &apos;s hard .
is that sensible ?
i &apos;m a novea .
but it goes .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
an enormous challenge .
we know this .
very interesting term .
it works the way .
it &apos;s terrible .
very scary .
i don &apos;t know .
and he says ...
i wonder .
that was fascinating .
not very sustainable .
here she is .
it &apos;s fast .
you need time .
that &apos;s the singing .
oh my god .
what about longevity ?
maybe 10 times as many .
conflicts are environmentally about creativity .
there &apos;s no normal .
oh , so that &apos;s the one .
that &apos;s very good .
a couple more .
players are not sitting around .
it sounds silly .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
so it &apos;s true .
i swear to it .
they &apos;re all important .
that &apos;s the most exciting thing .
who are these related ?
dark green . dark .
why do we do that ?
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
not very often happens .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
play is not silly .
so they do that .
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
yeah , i know .
how do we know that ?
dk : 60,000 .
be a mentor .
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
how are you interested .
that &apos;s all right .
so this is very risky .
it keeps you fresh .
hmmm , my brand ?
first of all , narration .
i have a question .
it &apos;s generic .
let me wrap up .
so how does it work ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
there were extrates .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
jk : both .
sounds familiar , what ?
i was pushing to him .
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
ooh , thank you .
thank you very much .
italy wins . yeah .
here &apos;s the video .
me made me mind awe .
so where do we go ?
the power station can explode .
and she secretly .
that sounds frightening .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s almost identical .
and i understand that .
thank you very much .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we can do it differently .
why does this happen ?
does anyone see something ?
that &apos;s our present .
give me a chance .
i want to tell you .
what are the media today ?
yes , it &apos;s going to be .
and it has to go back .
wonderful , &quot; huh ?
the whole environmental debate .
but the bad stuff .
what do you say ?
they have similar principles .
we can do that .
just do your job .
this was what happened .
what do you want to do ?
very expensive real estate .
they hurt themselves .
this was the result .
can we change it ?
do you do that ?
that &apos;s it .
this is the last .
good work ! yes !
so let &apos;s see .
yeah , good day .
thank you for listening .
not a toxic in it .
these days are over .
can i be honest ?
and i was an artist .
i &apos;m actually .
what do they do ?
the farm is incredible .
there is no food .
they get there . &quot;
i wanted to sponsor them .
what a fish .
we need a lot of hard wonder .
who is going to make it safe ?
that &apos;s great .
this is a wish .
bg : thank you .
let &apos;s call him don
it &apos;s a crisis .
you see it immediately .
i can say everything .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m interested in .
reset , slow .
a autistic student .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
you compare comparisons .
this is what &apos;s present .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
yeah , good day .
we were twenty people .
that &apos;s going to be true .
that &apos;s the system .
my gut feeling back .
and i kept working on .
it was actually crawling fish .
it doesn &apos;t work .
a thousand , very good .
i learned everything .
but i kept working on this .
so she was back .
and she did .
what do these people need ?
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s happened here ?
this is what happens today .
there are online criminals .
these people make money .
they sell videos .
privacy has to be given .
hey , why not ?
i don &apos;t know .
here &apos;s an example .
there are two options .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
what does the illusion do ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you very much .
so they get al .
and that &apos;s important .
they use their hands .
is it even at photography ?
i would say it again .
it would be intractable .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;m going to make children .
i find this fascinating thing .
i find this fascinating thing .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
i thought about it .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and why is that ?
it &apos;s called paul offit .
it was a huge success .
and that &apos;s quite astonishing .
and then finally , it &apos;s going to meet .
i tried to do something fascinating .
what do you think ?
so what do we need to do ?
this has the greatest impact .
so paul is a terrorist .
the data is doing the same thing .
i &apos;m going to tell you all .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
shame . shameful .
we have to spread the message .
yeah , here it is .
it was really profound .
what lessons do we learn ?
but what food do you eat ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
they want to feed the world ?
so they saw something magic .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
but it didn &apos;t .
how should our surveys look like this ?
so it &apos;s been constant .
first we have the population .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
next : nuclear energy .
and then there &apos;s all these kinds of things .
but the key thing is ...
they were sweeping the canals .
good afternoon , everybody together .
here you see the city .
these changes are coming in .
so what happened after that ?
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
sexual reproduction to the present .
some of them have come and went .
you see the timeline up there .
first extension , second .
and then all went down .
it did have a very badly guche of it .
you can have this cloud .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
and we got to one , great .
that sounds crazy , right ?
we &apos;ve been playing in a part of warcraft .
there &apos;s an old study .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
so , the correlation is low .
it &apos;s not true of emotion .
he had experience it .
or is it possible ?
the game is from 2007 .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
i think , rather than that .
what about fitness ?
he showed up to the algae .
we travel through ritual .
let &apos;s do it as well .
how do we actually do that ?
that &apos;s kind of unusual .
this is felix .
the orange tractor .
... his own story .
so what is now being lined ?
you see that there &apos;s the bottom down there .
let &apos;s just leave us .
this is the memory ponds .
they didn &apos;t have books .
they had no mass media .
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
that &apos;s not what he &apos;s going to do .
incepinist should work .
they really loved it .
you have to understand that .
but i felt worse .
initially , we only signed up with only signed .
now , what does that mean ?
so , what does that mean ?
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
here &apos;s another example .
do you want to do jeans with holes ?
and it depends on phosphorus .
these rivers are taking rapidly .
why should we do that ?
and i had always been .
i find them .
why not think about it ?
it &apos;s not being excunated .
quite an interesting phenomenon .
the living markings the spirits .
the name today , called stacking .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people .
it &apos;s against justice .
it will always be more like that .
i can say everything .
these things are logical .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
you know that most of you .
he was already over 60 .
it &apos;s not technological .
what would be done ?
and here &apos;s the representation .
and then you set up .
i only loved two loved loved .
you can train this .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
thankfully not , yeah ?
so we &apos;re too many .
you can &apos;t have bone .
it &apos;s working with children .
that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
no tree is neutral .
you can &apos;t store energy .
the work of the ingler .
but where are we useful ?
china was different .
but we need it all .
we say in germany .
every waste is nutrient stuff .
here you see it .
so i went to the court .
and as soon as the judge saw me .
it would be .
we love technology and creativity .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
it &apos;s not our problem .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
he went up and down .
what can we do ?
crisis . disaster . disaster .
it &apos;s not our fight .
and many people forget that .
the only country in the world .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i will never forget that .
but what do we do about this ?
and this opens up a map .
my cousins was around all around the place .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
my brother was staring at me .
i was devastated by the floor .
i &apos;m going to admit you something .
maybe that &apos;s true .
but they do the job .
this is a dead bar .
and once we started a alive .
my name is brian os .
it was a grouper .
it was still fish .
and is the escker .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
it doesn &apos;t have been documented .
you lose rare animals .
we have three main groups .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
some of these are a few mutations .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
actually , i made two mistakes .
my second error was worse .
talk about water wars .
and so it was .
i felt really good .
and there &apos;s good news .
he showed me here .
asked the nurse &apos;s worth .
their family was clupped .
and then it happened again .
that was really sad to me .
his name is knit .
what other brands do ?
that &apos;s a great question .
thank you very much for having .
yeah . all right . well .
the scores also match it .
we are a smaller brand .
what else is a mosquito ?
my name is amit .
and it took me 18 months .
i grew up in india .
that &apos;s a great question .
you see something fun here .
that &apos;s the short response .
and then something funny happened .
and it worked very well .
it feels great .
you see the water coming .
but it was very sad .
it seemed it was quite popular .
think of the camera .
and it &apos;s got better .
but it &apos;s getting worse .
is that yours ?
just further . lots of fun .
i had a good life .
maybe in our mobile phones .
it communicates these two people .
here &apos;s another example .
but it takes a lot of planning .
but there &apos;s something else about there .
after just a trip .
and then it became international .
did you see these guys ?
you see that .
that &apos;s something like this .
is it about the light ?
it has billions of them .
i lived in parallel worlds .
the two names called me .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
they come from artists .
this is what the graphics looked like .
okay , a couple more .
what am i looking at ?
and he came along and jimmy semel came .
privacy is not the debate .
and so the dynamics , the dynamics really changed .
it &apos;s the most powerful human being .
a billion people are starving today .
now i see greg lemond .
creativity had to be kind of out of the way .
and that was what i found tremendously .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
and it was a catastrophe .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
today , 6.8 billion people today live .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
i almost never do it .
that really does the problem of the fuel problem .
can &apos;t be a problem .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly efficient .
again , you have it again .
and you have a problem .
thank you for your attention .
it &apos;s working with a pitch .
they always say , why ?
this is just an insurance method .
it was still delicious .
this will happen next april .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
&quot; of course , i said .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
the chef had it .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
so the nature of the natural things are present .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
happy productivity . fantastic !
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
what &apos;s a story that &apos;s looking for ?
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
i reigiglate my sleeve .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
and finally , epends .
they &apos;re going to create a epic story .
so this crazy word could be voices .
so we can do that .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
and the shape is playing a role .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
and that made me knock up .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and architects and engineers , for happiness .
there are also world corots .
so that &apos;s the good news .
the same thing , only bigger .
they don &apos;t have to suffer things .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
the result of this was catastrophic .
because anybody here ?
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
nobody has ever told that .
it &apos;s automatically running right .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
that &apos;s such a natural thing .
what happened in the place ?
let &apos;s do a small balance .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
this picture reminded me of something .
here he is doing the sun .
now i put a bass .
anyway , to navigate .
so the question is : how ?
so , you know , you know .
this is a game out .
for example , this perception in context .
does anybody know what that is ?
so it &apos;s n circle .
what takes five in favor of what ?
what &apos;s the thing ?
then i can transmit the whole thing .
now , everything is easy to have .
and the answer is yes .
our magazines are read by millions .
the official dogma of what ?
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the answer is no .
a has these benefits and risks .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
okay , that &apos;s really what &apos;s really encouraging .
they could have been able to do it better .
so let me remind you .
everybody needs a goldfish of glass .
we have unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a way of doing it .
this is a shift of paradigm .
they moved out of each other .
the mechanism comes out of the lie .
picasso says wait .
it wasn &apos;t invented .
you know what &apos;s envy is ?
were you still standing ?
and how did it feel ?
i &apos;m shooting through the head .
this must be the age of aging .
so , basically , a translation of translation .
my wife told me .
i &apos;m interested in the firefire .
there he got .
here you have this little mechanism .
we can &apos;t do that just .
because it means that memory .
now there &apos;s a third set .
the side product is clean water .
or take some sticks .
and we take all of that .
and for the people who are in the urine .
and so we &apos;re too many .
noleler : yes ?
we can regress our nutrients .
we depend on two countries .
i set up an institute .
imagine the national efficiency .
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so it &apos;s going to get two volumes .
so , it &apos;s not like deone-x .
when the waste is the waste right now .
let &apos;s face it , who is normal ?
we didn &apos;t write this app .
how do i get away from ? &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
it &apos;s inverted itself .
nothing is not at all .
they didn &apos;t give the government abandoned .
i believed everybody could .
who would ever want one ?
something very strange is happening here .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
but that &apos;s not going to be fast .
further than that we &apos;re not going .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
but it has a very unexpected twist .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
that &apos;s , it &apos;s very simple .
the story is not over there .
okay , there are a couple .
who do you really want to make it ?
we need to rise to the complexity of complexity .
well , we want to do a better .
what happened that day ?
so there is a feedback .
the defeat was just to have been .
i never met him personally .
bj and sponsor were looking for them .
no , no one has been a way .
so i followed my reflection .
her mother she withher .
and they gave them a evolutionary advantage .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
the white lines represent the population .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
in fact , we are redefining poverty .
so the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
that was actually the crux of me .
we think about energy scarcity .
&quot; a more blue blue dot . &quot;
you should also choose to .
sometimes i get to love .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s not that way that doesn &apos;t work .
but , you know what ?
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
think about your own decisions .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
i was a little scared about technology .
that &apos;s a while that storytelling always took a sense of storytelling .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it .
we use the energy of the sun .
so we &apos;re going to do this with airplanes .
i started with my usual talk .
this is going to be in public domain .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
it &apos;s not our stunt .
i talk a lot about these questions .
what are you trying to do ? &quot;
third technology : yemation .
i was going to be very normal .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
this is about five meters long .
and this video is real time .
the data was not available before .
the whole building consisted out of water .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
they can play with various species .
this is the robert to dancing .
the game starts -- silence .
so that morning , before the game .
temple it is completely paralyzed today .
what will you do with this ? &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
no insurance can make a quomable .
we &apos;ve won a few awards .
they saw the great strike .
she did three years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
who doesn &apos;t want to care a lot of children ?
what would you like most ?
how many people would vote for creativity ?
is this all education ?
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
now , how could that happen ?
that &apos;s usually not the route .
they become in the computer in the free .
and that was 19 years ago .
well , i was the next one .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
and women made that successfully .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
this is a painting of a circle .
students are going to run through grades .
and we did that .
so we measured his movement .
i &apos;m going to show you now .
i should not say that .
you can be logical and causal .
they basically do the same thing .
this is a picture of the object .
so this is one of the images .
i see this plas .
and again , it showed ja4 .
needless to be polite .
we went into an area .
this is from this place .
one place is south korea .
these are all metadata .
they even get funding with it .
that &apos;s no problem at all .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
completely fully tied to a particular goal .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to the concrete .
we need to think about what brands are .
he switches the power engine .
they want to orient in the museum ?
a phenomenal dish really coffee .
overgenes : overgenes .
how would you describe your brand ?
i really like to brush clothes .
tell me about this world .
and it knocks up a 257 .
they were genetically modified .
it was my first sunburn .
the stones are color .
lego made it for every possible thing .
and that argument makes no sense .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry !
they tap into their internet connection .
the company headquarters is right here .
people were still happy .
she was back and die .
they grow them at a five-inch rate .
so , the emergency workers , they moved all the sites .
i &apos;m the redefined doctor .
it divides their experiences with others .
and it starts with a doctor .
all of this is inevitably unavoimisably avoicorrect .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but surely it would get it .
and it was an amazing experience .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
i was struck by this fish .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
so i just started playing .
music is medicine . music changes us .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
&quot; sustainable foods , &quot; he said .
how far is there that you have ?
we also have very very detailed data .
it &apos;s made us so sustainably .
they have the flow of water on the ground .
they literally put the levers up .
i &apos;m an expert with relationships . &quot;
how is the consumer score ? &quot;
and then we said , okay , okay .
he shook his head , no .
no , no , it can &apos;t .
and then he can walk away .
tell that what you feel .
and this kind of sounds different from the past .
so the first step to perinterpretation .
meanwhile , the instruments have been evolving .
behind the seven mountains , and so forth .
this is a scandal of the network .
you can go there .
i found it out particularly .
and here it &apos;s already here .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
these are all absolutely logical , and correct .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
get ready ? i was totally confused .
and it &apos;s not all interpretation .
my grandparents have been kept this number on the back of the way .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
and even even a mate is thinking .
they don &apos;t invest time in terms of power .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that can make a huge difference .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
anyway , we need a solution .
i &apos;m making the kind of applications ?
we forced them . pop .
not even the truth she will get free .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
so every concert is a different concert .
so that was a very peculiar experience .
they live with osynthesis .
for the kids ? &quot;
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
you can go in a particular year .
so i &apos;ll stop this , thank you very much .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
the shrimp consume the phytoplankton .
there are a lot of things that have to come together .
we have something that goes down .
that &apos;s what i found for energy .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
so this is a tough act .
it should have the two elements .
it &apos;s like talking about talking .
a language is the expression of the human spirit .
so , have a nice thing to do this .
so , that was my primary motivation .
and the list can continue on a long way .
seriously -- the doom of ice !
go and quereril .
ice is red with red .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
and this picture was taken from atlas .
this is the machine that is under geneva .
for a long time than those other networks .
it was a pretty fancy project .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
i &apos;d like to prove you this .
no , no , far uninterrupted .
so we needed about 50 of the magnet magnet .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
they &apos;re all the questions .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
you can do something about anything .
they are the country of the people .
156 countries bring off our next-channel channel .
let &apos;s take a little push now .
this is my supermarket . not big .
now , again , again , a glimpse of this .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
well , this cartoon is some of the statements .
third : esessterity .
the truth is more like this .
we started this 15 years ago .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
on the book , and on the image .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to drink .
for example , the landcup , yes ?
it &apos;s a geny-achievable thing .
to ask what is the right ?
in the way we think of the north .
every footprint is there .
so not saving , let &apos;s avoid , avoid , avoid .
you can show , i was there .
so you can &apos;t solve this .
so guys can &apos;t be pigs .
what &apos;s just presented was just presented .
there &apos;s also the same thing .
if they come to that , yes ?
we can reinvent everything else .
the present reasons it &apos;s writing .
but really , really , yes ?
how did he see ?
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it &apos;s got to process it as present .
and then they &apos;re starting to forget in the third one .
you see , first of the back to the front .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see what &apos;s going to see .
a dalmatines , right .
i see the dalsatiner .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
and everything is fine or content .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that &apos;s what we call the speech model .
everyone &apos;s got there .
and the curiosity isn &apos;t learning .
that &apos;s just a little bit less disdevastation .
because we don &apos;t want to move any genes around ?
we worked late until late .
her father died after her birth shortly after her birth .
he moved back to the silence .
he died , broken through the story .
all of the adults were aware of the risks .
something is edited in me .
we had no cents for a year .
who could have looked at this ?
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and yet , i &apos;m still making a physical level .
the shore is from another place .
and i salute every morning .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology .
nobody has to give up your ideas .
oh , my time is over ?
now we saw the rise effect .
and i want to read you to read this .
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand a morning .
it just sumemcified a thousand miles .
here &apos;s her marpper .
so this is a modest little app .
even cats watch this video .
my fourth technology : for example , for complexity .
motors , gears -- four ways .
oh my god . oh my god .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
he got all sorts of natural videos .
... it &apos;s making it worthwhile .
but then you really want to go deep in it .
well , i entered the courthouse .
i &apos;d put that crazy stuff .
i think our identity is threatened .
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot;
we want to do something about the death penalty company .
i &apos;m tired of losing up how we all .
then he whispered me in the ear .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
we don &apos;t really know much about this .
i think there are ways to do that everywhere .
but possibly this is not the case .
child mortality has lost about a tenth of a tenth .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and we &apos;re more excited about our leaders .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
you go around and you &apos;re kind of preparation .
it can know where we are .
these are the apsaras .
and this worked . give for scott .
good night , sweet marrat . &quot;
and these are the neural structures .
i tried to understand them .
when i was 16 , i started to illustrate books .
so scott gets this anitbal .
i classify people in death cells .
i learned this from my grandmother .
she was a saint family &apos;s daughter .
the silence is oe-conthetic .
a lot of my mandations are very young .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of things .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
so , look what happens .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
i remember my first fire .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they shared the kingdom in the two halves .
we can give ourselves something like ourselves .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
but what &apos;s going to come to the future ?
these are going to be inmissistic .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
five million people use it every month .
but the game is a shape-walks .
they &apos;re both viable , both light .
it turns out it &apos;s a really difficult idea .
do we really want to go to that direction ?
conditions of this species exist with us .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
i call this the radiation tiger .
we get a absolutely flat line .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i hold the knife in my hand .
the dosage is a role .
everybody would like to make people happier .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
daniel kahneman : sure .
monday : color &apos;s a powerful force .
and we have total 1.5 -billion players .
no , i mean really serious .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so the first place of the talbal talp .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
and the goal here is very simple .
so ... so that &apos;s not as serious .
which in terms of words would you describe by the accident ?
this is a game game , right ?
that &apos;s what i mean , in my mind .
okay , you really want to know ?
i went to prison -- difficult .
the goal of this film is transparency .
and i had to go out of the city .
it &apos;s all coming out of our pockets .
we talk about bold , fresh .
and this is a million million million .
you brought your pictures , yes ?
i like things that are different .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist right now .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the film has not been done yet .
it was built four and a half in italy .
and , in italy , it ended up in the end .
be just who you are .
wednesday : embrace your inner community .
thursday morning : confidence is the key .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
let &apos;s start with the sound .
tuesday : adaptation is completely overseeded .
thank you very much , this was incredible .
the roof was also covered with water .
you can do this all the time .
but the truth is far away .
and that was the outer outbreak .
he can only use his eyes .
now look at this graph .
bjfree : regenerative space .
and his response was yes .
it can give you a sequence of changes .
and that &apos;s no mere rain to get out of it .
this is alfred gonzere .
she wasn &apos;t getting tired yet .
i thought i could integrate myself .
what do you do with gamma ball ?
but western governments also help themselves .
but we &apos;re far beyond that .
and the difference is then perceived as a loss .
notice two things that this curve is going to do .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
because we live on a water planet .
what are these three billion people bring to ?
so , this has been a problem for supercomputer .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about distinguctive ways .
they gave their blood pressure .
why am i going to medicine ?
by alone , stable and without support .
so bevivid is open source .
so , basically my two passions are the two .
so , this blew me .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
you can jump directly to a specific case .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
i was completely science , you know .
i was not going to disfuriate .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm every morning .
&quot; this is successful . &quot; he said .
i was obsessed obsessed obsessed with the deep sea .
we went back to the camel .
so what can we exclude from all this ?
is it easy enough to go a quarter ? &quot;
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
so what do you do with the waste ?
the logic doesn &apos;t make any sense of reality .
you say , there &apos;s no precedent .
and one phrase , with his own breath .
and especially a beautiful story , as i think .
because now you can apply a three-sentence sentence .
and you know that from school you know about school .
there are three phrases in this tricate .
i &apos;ve summarized the last three of five , i &apos;ve summarized up .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
we have 20-percent in germany .
these were the very first calculations in six years .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
for nathaniel , music seelial health .
i said , &quot; chicken , drinking nets ? &quot;
the internet and its services is a miracle .
his personal little acquists .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
well , i &apos;ll show you .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t work .
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we don &apos;t want companies to be able to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want firms to have doctors .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
we have now now tagged followers in this country .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
i normally would take the needle out .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
he had had a 20 minutes of music .
now , would you ever choose holiday holiday ?
they have it . they &apos;ve always got it .
it &apos;s a negotiation print .
you can predict the predictions . why is this happening ?
they conduct the process , they understand it .
this will be a key element of this .
there are lots of great books that are happening in this topic .
we need to be doing more research in research .
in the nuclear sector there are other innovative companies .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
here &apos;s a picture of an area in kentucky .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t really do that .
what happened to me happened with this design student ?
we pasted this kind of exercise with the same student .
there was never a time of how this one was .
does anybody know what that is ?
we talk about ethniment .
most of all , he had since he died .
now that level of intuition is very important .
that &apos;s such a worthy part .
the water sheets were expanding .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
oh , jesus , what thought !
if not , querals now , somebody else .
his whole process of work has changed .
this is a annual storm of water .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we have thousands of organisms that do it .
this is one , part of it .
the fact is that coal is not dirty .
it &apos;s about a newrest of america .
we have to come far away , and it &apos;s very quick .
and these interactive portraits are true each other .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge that is for 9 offer .
this is an interactive signature pan .
here &apos;s a couple of tiles that we see here .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
in other parts -- the world of communication .
we don &apos;t invent identity ; we invent them .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
i &apos;m very happy to be there .
they laughed more than her do .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
they worry about that for us to stand out there .
they increase the paralysis and increase satisfaction .
we always tried to ask ourselves a profound question .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
and they &apos;re also feeling your movement and tilt .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
and we see it &apos;s a real time .
but the phosphorus is not able to replace .
because that &apos;s what it has , right ?
there is no outpopulation of living in trees .
we can support them , well .
we can support them , well .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
sometimes the environment , make less waste .
the phosphor problem is much more critical .
that &apos;s not how we are not resources , it &apos;s efficiency .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient efficient ?
but with the real design , please .
in two hours , it &apos;s going to build all the time .
it &apos;s not all that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
this is in china in a second .
all right , these wind around , almost .
every society is highly involved by a primary medium .
the tribal society , at the beginning , was through the language .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
but i &apos;ll get to that for a second .
what we left is the counter .
i want to explain a little bit about a little bit .
so from modern in the computer society .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
and there is a central point here .
just admiting what is information ?
now you &apos;re looking at the dalmtiner .
and further , now you &apos;ll see it .
so it says the norm is that it &apos;s more likely to be .
i try this by a example of an example .
thank you . i have a question for you .
she &apos;s got a button , and she &apos;s on the wastes .
so , soon next week , it comes to the market .
i &apos;ve not been familiar with the etiquette .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let you go . &quot;
the underwater part is from a stone radius .
and here &apos;s every piece of work on this .
my mother was advising my boat .
well , it was friday , it &apos;s right .
it may take you until it &apos;s been loaded .
so there &apos;s a nice game dynamic .
today , a lot of people have given government .
boston didn &apos;t just have a call center .
scott abwed himself to person .
but there were many people shredded over the years .
and we use this word with such contempt .
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
emc presents the transparency of transparency .
but i &apos;m going to show you the demo .
you can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
... if you could just show a slide for this .
in fact , no one &apos;s intended video .
now , who is ready to go for that trip .
because it doesn &apos;t feel really much money .
there are two different types of different types .
whohh : east globww !
in 2010 it was 23 million times .
that &apos;s the ballot to the system that is necessary .
we should put the bear in the cage .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
it &apos;s slowing down for any of our big problems .
it seems to me that it seems to be replived both .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
we want to eliminate mass prosecuders . &quot;
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
he came up to me and hugging me .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
there are some very interesting things .
thirty years ago , this would have ridiculous .
it &apos;s connected in oxygen and guies .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
we &apos;ve just passed the seven-brand brand .
we have the passion of a dict-innovators .
the death penalty death is defined by mistake .
the first is an classical class , apple .
it can know how we hold it .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
the next step was actually going in these communities .
tell me , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
it &apos;s malmizand odd programs .
we &apos;re in the middle of this sweeping place .
they were inspired by being inspired by us .
so , every drip would be a little different .
but still seem enough to be here .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
i said , &quot; i promised , i promised . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandma . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
this country is unlike 40 years ago .
and finally , we should be welcome transparency .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
or are they more like a rup-beelobeer ?
but bonobos show us the other side of the memedal .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
it &apos;s not the test of survival and success .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population of population population .
the main man , waving me .
ladies and gentlemen , their own relationships .
i tried to keep the body .
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
so two pairs , each one &apos;s a baby .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys .
intermateriating traditional sexuality in many different forms .
so a lot of testosterone , but no response to it .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
so , gender can occur in many different varieties .
this is &quot; lifelless oil . &quot;
8,000 players were playing the play eight weeks .
and there &apos;s a way of staff .
i &apos;m not getting in the real life of this feedback .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s the truth .
players are masters of the spiders of social users .
but it &apos;s definitely not a optic situation .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
and of course , then , it &apos;s made .
what do you think it &apos;s going to happen next ?
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
but it &apos;s not just about words .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
wietties are just too easy to live .
we don &apos;t know why this is happening .
this is one of the classic yemen in play .
because otherwise our problem is even greater .
this is just the title title .
make it possible -- you all here .
now , imagine a full smoke hit .
i never want to move a way in life .
so that made sense , it was fit together .
so again , that &apos;s a really good fit .
ordinary people are not available . &quot;
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
no , that was what i thought .
i want to help you to calm down .
these things have a more positive effect .
you want to tell me about my brand .
tell me a little bit about this part .
this is something like our firefighter .
on drilling table -- no , thank you .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you do people from their character ?
so i think we need to be leaders .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
and i &apos;ll just sum this for you for you .
they had a concept of blue blood .
as an artist , i &apos;m really interested in the association .
so that &apos;s why this project is the case .
here you see the building working .
i want to share with you something that is first .
so that you can experience the whole movement .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropic .
it supports other of their mistakes to talk about .
it &apos;s a completely disject of abuse .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
you &apos;ll be less , because we &apos;re going to start them .
so you don &apos;t lose a very often privting animal .
but they don &apos;t have the previous losses .
if you generalize it , what happens is .
we still think , you know , they were originally .
i &apos;m a human . i do mistakes .
it &apos;s the average power of bat .
what you need is a new medical culture .
i was a compulvely obsual student .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
and i thought that was a kidney stones .
it was a lot of time , and i &apos;m going to go .
but i turned to these questions .
and that was what i felt .
that &apos;s the kind of educational shame .
the three words say : do you remember ?
and feedback comes from my high doctor .
so you can &apos;t sit them out there .
here he is picking up a rare rail .
now , he said the genetics of the genetics .
so smart grid , a huge theme of it .
and that &apos;s the n that &apos;s the message .
and in the time they can react to other things .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i set up .
so , great thing is , we have a business model .
and then you have a whole bunch of simulation .
&quot; look at her look at , &quot; look at her . &quot;
the fl-go eat the shrimp .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s all over . it &apos;s all online .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue for government .
so light light then takes smart grid grid .
when i was a kid i constantly drew these comic books and stuff .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
the first two words , they are logical .
he &apos;s just in touch with himself .
because artists have a disconnect to lie .
because without the time we cannot live without these life lies .
so , we can &apos;t even whoun all these things .
so it &apos;s going to be coming from the outside to the human .
and so i got a little hunity decision .
that &apos;s no one in the world .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any sense of what &apos;s true .
we can run these things in different examples .
and yes , i &apos;ll go on a slide .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
our goal was to just say , okay , okay .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize .
it &apos;s not just a nice soundy .
we had not had a polio event in this country yesterday .
do you have all of your vitamins that morning ?
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i &apos;m .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and not only are being used to be used to meases .
but you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
diphry , they starred , baby paralysis ...
why do we do this ? why do we do that ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of placebo .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
it &apos;s a debate about words about metaphor .
there was no canitudermos .
they were just like people in this room .
he lived only nine years .
the gears the u.s. for hundreds of years .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
there is a link , a mutual respect .
i think at first point , the curiosity is .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
so , climate change is going to be a great thing .
this has to be very downward , zero .
that sces doesn &apos;t bring us any money .
my parents are the 80 on the heel .
because they &apos;ve got special skills of the process .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping prototyping .
it produced the highest construction in the time .
so we have this machine here .
my grandparents died now when they were 60 .
can you actually play them in blue ?
you just hear it and then they start talking .
it &apos;s not really spoken on interpretation .
everybody knew , your genius was a little law .
the land on the land was hurting .
it has huge endings in the control room .
and they had to remove them from what we were doing .
you &apos;re all of them back to your way .
yes , i &apos;m scared of all of these things .
like algae -- and other terrifying things .
it &apos;s about 300 million million .
that &apos;s a six-second footage of a 40-second period .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
if your job is to do that , fix it .
and if it wasn &apos;t , fix even your dance .
it grows in the winter and it &apos;s declining in summer .
this is a organism in 1996 .
this is a completely non-descrilow development pattern .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and the problem is not the technology itself .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
there are those who are much more table .
we had to have to be driven for lawyers and so on .
the first market is new . find it more .
some people were disappointed there was no poetry .
freedom to maximize choice is to maximize choice .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
but here &apos;s what you might have thought .
i mean , everybody in my manhattan &apos;s neighborhood is gone .
your problem is that they have too little .
but the volume are substantially larger than ever before .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through drilling .
we can actually look at the junk problem .
one baby needs about six thousand diases .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something .
how can i make a very much amount of user use ?
and less juice or use is it &apos;s .
sometimes the environment , needs less energy .
a research of the subject of natural user interface .
and we &apos;d like to see that .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it is useful .
so , let me just take a little bit .
do you remember the winwer ?
we understood that the weather is global .
and in my juvenile fortune , i said .
yeah , so what is bioame ?
now , what are the archaic models ?
if you want to come far , come together . &quot;
now he &apos;s taking a tractor into the scene .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more stuff about this .
i can put the sequence as it is happening .
i &apos;m looking forward to the talk of all of you .
new investments , to create good paid jobs .
anyway , they do that .
or they didn &apos;t have any photo cography .
and in that mind , the memory was remembered .
from the printing age to the machine age .
another example is that the virtual reality is called virtual reality .
and the two more and more important ones are here .
we got off , which hasn &apos;t work .
you get on two because very simple .
here we were , and this is the painting .
what other extra charismatic suggests they have ?
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
or are they more like a sambebebebebeer ?
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
he &apos;s not even gone out in other countries .
lawyer : i &apos;m a stocknewalbrand .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
the best part is -- in a second .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
and that was an experience of being in humility for me .
i mean , nobody ever saw any particles .
it &apos;s the way i want to be .
the rest of the time are delta .
you know how many people watching these tedtalks ?
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
in fact , there &apos;s still a lot more dangerous and more aggressive .
so this is what we need to do with digital security systems .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
it &apos;s just to get away as far as you can .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
man 3 : i &apos;m the narkerman .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is probably &quot; no &quot; to be &quot; no . &quot;
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake .
all right , what is the brand ?
it &apos;s just more accurate , you might agree .
so we start with a windows drug .
we have all the replacon-systems systems in our cars .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
and let me give you a simple example .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
i always start with a piece , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
is it all the details or the color ?
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
we &apos;ve been asking , and nobody knew .
and we have a model for this .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
al is a hydrant in boston .
but that was not the end of the tasmanian ree demographic .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s being put together .
my grandmother never forgot my life .
so , the theme of the day : resource saving .
a typical wal-mart brand today is carrying you 100,000 products .
i think i probably heard more hands .
it was viewed nearly 200 million times this year .
it &apos;s been viewed in almost 50 million times .
and also , as designers and tech designers are very interested in .
my mother called a few minutes after that .
no apple ever tasted that again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about something .
there was still a different puzzle piece .
&quot; don &apos;t be &quot; but turned out to be an untrue thing .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 code code .
we &apos;re ignorant of food .
and this is the planning .
edward calliova is a scientist .
i &apos;ll just tell you , this is logical .
this is a player that &apos;s just a epndied .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
and this constant feedback is not in real life .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
as a result of this , we build stronger social relationships .
what are the emotions that could be measured ?
there seems to be an uncoherent way .
what we want to do is create the future .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
maybe we can see persistence as change .
it was summer and i had grown up .
again , what would you do now ?
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
raise your hands . let me see .
what ? that really blew me .
am i really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
you know , science is not a company .
this investment in africa has been in the last 30 years .
and why ? economic changed food .
you wouldn &apos;t be reluctant to , you know what ?
there &apos;s someone sitting there who had no childhood .
how many would be a good memory ?
and you &apos;re going to ask : what happens to these moments ?
people in the courts come in right now .
let me show you about the point .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
well , remember , the mind itself is a storyteller .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that anything was changed .
yeah , you &apos;re right . we fix it .
so they communicate -- they walk along your fingers .
so i started at a conference several months later .
second season , the normal time of regular time .
tasdane , in a moment of headhead .
well , we introduced the mayor to hole .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
on the left , you see a little boat .
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
but there was a life cycle in her presentation .
and we need to improve a lot about this machine .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
it was something we knew .
so , imagine a sound airplane .
france makes a post . italy is a post .
i had no longer to talk to the guards .
so they &apos;re going to put on , save the shoes .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relative .
i want to get it to not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life life .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
as i said , amanda wears our conduct .
i was a dog . i was talking about envy .
we have been there for about 130,000 years .
they moved to a culture concept .
and we learn trust and the game &apos;s rules .
in other words , play is our adaptsk .
just think of it for a moment .
so we have this awful fully simplifying idea .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and this is very important in medical research .
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to ?
do you know how to call a 40000ter ?
well , really good , maybe a single star .
we have access to tools using exponential technology .
i put them and made me do the treatment .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called foldit .
and i went back to work .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
different speakers : drug war , weapon . tornado .
and that was not a hard to do a diagnosis diagnosis .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
i remember it as being yesterday .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a loss .
and yet , we still get on the galapagos .
let me show you how they work .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
the question is , why is people accept this .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
that &apos;s what our goal is now .
she barely touched , and she was steched up .
he described one of them as a very , very common .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
she didn &apos;t have a very able brain .
what would you tell somebody who believes ?
rat rat ? yes . alive ? yhsy .
it could take place within an educational learning event .
the combined condition was an interesting step .
now we &apos;re going to do this with forces and machines .
so , it &apos;s kind of mass overshns .
and try to do it again with another generation .
i found fireflies in a glass very exciting .
communities are starting to abstract information again .
it also shows other parts of the book .
all of those were , they started sharing .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
we are more than that , we are citizen citizens .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
and the way through the rest of the book .
and i went over and i heard .
wealth , not debt , reduces the outcome .
then i ask , how could this happen ?
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work .
we want to get down the number of ports .
and i have to say , there was power .
an amazing error rate , one of nine innocent people .
and then at a place , the monitor is growing with leaves .
my uncles died in alcohol diseases .
so first i thought that was a game .
she had the last word in every family debate .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
they have a renewables today of 15 percent today .
and the question is , why didn &apos;t you ?
the soul is such a kind of thing , say , before .
that &apos;s the idea of the soul .
so if it says , there &apos;s no soul .
because actually this person is not in the case of evidence .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering .
there &apos;s only the second best to do the fire brigade .
so do this , and then you &apos;ll experience the phrase .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
and there &apos;s now a whole lot of research now .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and he &apos;s walking along his toritant states .
bruno giusani : thank you very much . thank you .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
it &apos;s got a food accept of 15 to one .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
i can &apos;t play as well as in 20 years .
i say , heart , heart angel , right ?
because , you know , it &apos;s a nice process .
hey , puma , do you really really want to be really serious ?
because they have already changed the ceo of the ceo .
in the countries where people get to money .
&quot; p. one ? what feeds your ? &quot;
why do i have to do n a car ?
and there he is , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s this ?
because the notes are right to him .
the music instrument is the extension of our body .
but maybe you can also vote in the mood .
and that was the first beginning of a very backyard expression .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
we &apos;ve been used in holland now for three years .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
where is the greatest interest , what really does it really work ?
in fact , the progression society on energy advances are based on energy .
probably one of these numbers must come close to zero .
the second factor is the services we use .
in each of these five areas , we need to at least 100 people .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
and i say , &quot; all you don &apos;t even care about .
why do i do this ? what do you do ? &quot;
this is a version of one thing done .
bg : an energy cure is the most important thing .
those who are doing the scientific arguments are very little .
the main problem here is similar to the same thing than the aids .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and also , the energy grid for them is very important .
that means the ants tend to weigh more than we do .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
he &apos;s a biologist at a biologist la palma .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen this one .
so , as we get the background of the belly , the better the system . &quot;
cut a fish , but also a electric reserve .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
and i &apos;m talking , an expedition was going to fund .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
with piston , you can dive into a decade .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
we talk about the flukers of information flow .
i grew up with a pro-ham science fiction .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
and of course , we share the same emre-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-core regime .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
we take images of this mini big big system on detectors .
we were wired , they reacted . they reacted .
our steps at the developing world of life were exponentially .
and it turns out dna is very difficult .
you may have heard that we have watermarks in it .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
we &apos;re going to focus on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
secondly , what economists call opopiight costs .
and the world we lived in saw was like this .
by march , the lhc will be reable to refunction .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
i have another 40 years of time in me .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t come in and form a human .
but unfortunately , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
if you want to do a crion-line , you have to be crioting between the images .
the ethnic sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
it &apos;s our new country &apos;s new country .
every big picture is the dawn of a hit .
or other models , or even technical techniques .
but nonetheless , there &apos;s a political dispute in our country .
and we &apos;re so often re-interested in re-changing how we want .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
the official belief ceremony of all the western industrialized societies .
i just want to say just a little bit about salleings .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and beolington ! open for you all this .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring children to the world .
there &apos;s going to be more to my glasses .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
and the whole thing is a game , i need to say .
i &apos;m going to clean up all of what &apos;s there .
it was like it used to happen to be on the village .
and what is it really happening in it ?
so how do we work when we look inside it ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to you , that &apos;s the gene age age .
the only thing they had was your head .
that &apos;s the period where you fall in love .
and six-two , also a very interesting phenomenon .
so how does a human being faced with certain things .
if we actually don &apos;t take phosphorus and give it up .
in the soil , over 60 percent of the carbon dioxide has stored .
we used to be used to things linear .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
here &apos;s another couple of people who are testing it .
so for him , they were just building light .
frosty , the coal man , he &apos;s getting clean every day .
this is the source of the most coal in west virginia .
so don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
it &apos;s boere coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
you &apos;ve seen it for you in the news .
you &apos;re mapping reality , you know , without computers .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language .
now , this is not a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke .
so what are the projects we &apos;re doing right now ?
that &apos;s a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
how many channels does the house that they live ?
1m is the highest thing i saw .
these are the people who are going to think of the world .
what &apos;s next to you about .
it &apos;s unambiguous -- like this strange landstrip .
so , how exactly are we going to see sususuin in the movie ?
are they ? you &apos;re looking nervous .
and then we give one of these great tapes .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
they were absolutely unrelated to the project .
how much money is required to get that one ?
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
a little bit more about them , that &apos;s not what you are .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that &apos;s dealing with it .
and how did that be for you ? what successful it was successful ?
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
i really like your , sergey brin . now .
so you &apos;re just going to google prestou.com.
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found this .
it &apos;s natasha &apos; and it &apos;s just natasha .
he says , &quot; make it wartered for the ground . &quot;
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
and in the world , everything makes a sense for me .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
you can see in all these museums here .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
think about it . that attack is generic .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to confront .
so the driving force is the cyberpltiest superpower .
i worked in a coal piece -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been photographing in war-setting , difficult and dangerous .
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no more .
i want to tell you about today and everywhere .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
it was completely disconnected that they could fail .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
and this video was actually sent in january .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
and all of this leads to us a big question .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
after three months of a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the actual electron .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
i met the decision to pull into the united states .
if i say reality , i &apos;m color-reality .
because the imagery would make it feel better .
now , there &apos;s all this little snosscent of the great unveiling talns .
look , let me give you an analogy .
we found that it &apos;s really moving .
you zody in . you can actually go into it .
this is a star night , probably never before .
this is the really cool part , which is called the stamp .
i think they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
but my logical point doesn &apos;t like it .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
they had 348 different kinds of marry rode .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
we &apos;re far from that goal .
in fact , this intersection has a 100 square kilometers of miles .
this is an idea worth spreading .
the pilot was designing the machine for the hudson river .
i thought we &apos;ll make the same deal .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
that &apos;s not the case of remembering your mind .
but now , can you count my finger , do you know ?
what it was ruined was the memories of experience .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
now , the life itself is continuously continuously alive .
probably a lot of you know in this room that &apos;s a trick .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife just like my hand .
the wildlife self itself does not have a voice in that choice .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person is living .
well , you &apos;re not going to get your life yourself .
i mean , i &apos;ve never seen the flat lines .
the more money you deserve is you deserve the more powerful .
and that also , as well as well , is playing .
and that &apos;s from an economist . so he &apos;s an economist .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo media .
this is an idiot debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and i took a while to find that out .
this is scandalingly , and we should be ashamed .
so we &apos;re going away from , and where are we going ?
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
and i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1000-1,000 years .
you need this , and we don &apos;t have them .
it &apos;s just a bed calories . it &apos;s mies .
anyway . i mean , i certainly want to .
i &apos;ll take him to do it for you and then explain it .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my little suitcase .
but are we going to make the best of our play drive ?
and this is called a call gene gene .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girl .
we see that in all sorts of different human life .
we see the same thing in the disabled rights movement .
well , chimps are famous for their invials .
he &apos;s steel every five of my consciousness .
i have something i want to show you .
it was the footdance contest , the footdance cup .
so here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
we called it the digital water babbabon .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a surge iceberg .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates .
so they &apos;re going around and they do art installations like these .
and so it was , like , three months .
how about the longer to live with good health ?
this is an amazing adventure , and you can go .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world shifting games !
here &apos;s the latest version of this imaging sequence .
see , dr. kean has changed his mind .
they teach them to open up themselves .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
now , berkeley forestry is these robots exoskeletons .
this is another look at the tree of life .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty in biology .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
and then think about two other little changes .
but at the same time we know that it &apos;s not possible .
he was invited the king of sisiat .
that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers are coming in .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
there &apos;s a program that might already be familiar .
he took a famous photograph . how was it called ?
so let &apos;s give this analogy into the future .
and the entire time was collected more and more .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the need for the assistance .
it was the misguided meeting on the drugs .
this deputy pupe ran across the older black .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
right , bryan , the judge has chilatory forces .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
we want to help people who were guilty of the unrator .
i studied the photograph of the picture , and she was in breathing .
somebody had broken up and had a great hack .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
it was called the automatically colored stone .
but you can still ask , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign surgeon ?
unemployment is a certified configuration .
now , how do people die in a consequence of this wire ?
it was always so inspiring to have so inspirational .
in the future , most crime will be online .
they put on the radio machine .
the knicks describe the other way they &apos;re pristine .
now he &apos;s on the red list now .
you probably know that he was 35 .
i was shocked , and i was disshattered into the inner bones .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital nature of this .
he &apos;s called &quot; double-rat &quot; into the official database .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so the paethesthesmovement movement has done it .
we need to release the government &apos;s machinery .
because this is where government labor is happening .
they hold up these , deweigh the rest .
but what happens to the citizens connect is different .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of this yet .
this is the call center for service and information .
so he got the citizen to test them .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
we know one where all the stations are .
so today , evolution is happening in the time of microseconds of microseconds .
combine , but you can create something special as this .
finally , i get programs that can make numbers pretty much .
my grandfather was in the bibiyard in prison .
i remember it was yesterday .
and so these women were just dressed and they were just kind of stuck .
and yet there &apos;s this mental disintegration .
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death in germany .
i have given a few talks in germany .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
we silly there , we were just hanging around like that .
and the child in me really is really excited with the means of possibilities .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
she was also the relationship of many major conflict in our family .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
you can say things like this , the world influence .
we brought chilsighted notes to design schools .
the one on a farm you &apos;ve heard not feed your animals ?
it &apos;s this interconcered taste .
so in my life , i &apos;ve laid a lot of fish .
so you could imagine him being able to sell him .
i ate him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a sophomologist had talked about this fish for a long time .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
we have cut cutting out of tagigawatts of taalik in germany .
then we have to break our must-in-class capacity on the net .
i mentioned this to perguel and then he &apos;s found .
because they are the people who are experts who are experts .
and i see a different pattern of it coming out .
you can test it after my talk in your doretuary rooms .
so i go back and give it to the perspective .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
from that time , an anecdote you might know .
i want to give you two examples , maybe three examples .
so please stop when there is a music being playing .
i have a friend who &apos;s touering a passerlet .
that &apos;s when half of its value is half of its value .
and at all , you work a lot less than i did .
and then immediately , i &apos;m coming up , this is just unsfine .
we &apos;re going to show it to the present sequence of the film .
it comes from asia , which is in the case of japan .
i can say the kanoilist is a man .
he &apos;s quite happy about it because he got them correctly .
but it &apos;s actually the sum , of course , a lot of ideas .
but , in fact , in the &apos; 80s , it wasn &apos;t that way .
have you negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been searching a new bird shelter .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
it &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
she herself to herself . more . they never never die .
we don &apos;t think our healthcare care system is mies .
they get to thgeon in south africa .
you know , there was no doubals in paradise .
there were no christmas trees . we did all this .
ask you , ask the evidence , ask evidence .
there &apos;s a step-by-step manual there .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
i mean , are we asking , why do we fight this ?
there is no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can be shown to your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
these are a lot of deaths than masders , 20 per hour .
the x &apos;s interpretation of a piece is like this .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
so , a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
and so , i changed making movies , completely , completely .
you have to be ready to take risks for you .
well , the energy grid is creelly .
people here have given the evolution of many of these wonder .
it &apos;s the renewables of renewables , as many of them are called .
i learned a lot to learn in the process of discovery .
so , the best , bad team of one under the best .
there are some innovations in the nuclear scale ; those are available , liquic .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
the fact is that uncertainty should worry about us .
ceos are happy . it &apos;s going to be interesting here .
this is what happened . not a team had a very strong structure .
i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and the key motivator for this is extinction .
so the heads heads on the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
in 25 years , it will be gone here .
and the suggestion was to build many more coal-plants .
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of breaking out of panic , he just heard .
he ended up running all the way , and he did a completely new thing .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
i would rather do this work that i love .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
one of the ads of the cooking company for christmas was this .
the most powerful mountain workers is the head of massey split .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells even well .
so if i put them on top of them , it makes interest .
if we overgo , we can break back a little bit .
this is what i got to the old greece and the old rome spill .
so i know about some of those who don &apos;t have them .
why do they advertise us , if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the world we live in now is what it looks like .
they get a model that comes from all over the world .
and it does this because of the content in the pictures .
one of the consequences of that was that the phone was never broken .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
it &apos;s just beginning to do that .
i gave a prize to the lhc at the last ted conference .
and the question is , are they good news or bad news ?
this struck me when i was going to replace my jeans generating .
do you want to put down buttons or inego ? stone or acid ?
economists call this a parettic application .
you don &apos;t know anything in this big fish glass . &quot;
this is our youngest one-enteta on the bottom right .
there are a series of photographs here , and here they are .
it &apos;s a matter of refour behavior , yes ?
they can throw away where they go and stand .
that means that this means that the gangme-seese marriage is going .
the opec is a bunch of orphans .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
when they run , yes , every footprint was the ground .
you &apos;ve seen a neutral tree ?
that &apos;s how to think about the pandemic of pandemic .
that means we are useful , we &apos;re useful not to do that .
because we don &apos;t do it more freely .
there &apos;s a direct instant system that &apos;s available system .
you collect information about the piece in the middle of english literature .
i &apos;m going to take that audience to realize , consciously , or unconsciously .
even if you were shooting to shoot , you would have emissions .
i will never pretend to pretend that i will ever be as much as i &apos;m going to do this moment .
i &apos;m sorry that i need to have a lot of cruch-up .
but i &apos;m going to make it more curious .
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
and the life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
then the neural forces of the pre-industrial cultures .
we have an abstract abstract language .
these are rooms that can respond smart to people .
and the third area , which explains actually self-plying itself .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
and of course , how does it take influence in perception .
and then , again , that &apos;s coming back .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve just described the same thing .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
that &apos;s the most time that we have .
this is my meat , and i can rotate it around .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
cats watch cats watching this video .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing housing .
all the parties , all of the questions of society , supported this .
each of these subjects , of course , was out of many , many smaller decisions .
i want to talk about the problem and some of the potential solutions .
we can better deal with more than more choices than more choices .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the way that this approach is all about new things we do .
they were the most dominant fear of pirates against pirates , rape and death .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell you .
opportunities that were not allowed to be explicitly .
so quantum mechanics says that inmovable objects are just as feeling .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
welcome the fear . welcome them to the risk .
you open the map , and jump along with a click .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of this .
are you eight of us and poff like 0.7 ?
well , finally , the film has gained a very large momentum .
finally , moving forward , we should be the fear of the fear .
what is the trick that makes it realistic to make it realistic ?
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip .
they are , they &apos;re going to the end of the gang .
in the previous example , we had to find the details of the details .
there are many other things , but i &apos;m missing time .
for example , this is a person who &apos;s totally clear .
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
three months later , i was moved , and i went on .
and the movie is called &quot; the the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
so , if you could get the light back to this .
what is this new state that &apos;s going to slow up to the world ?
and the next thing took about another billion years .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
so we &apos;ve dodged the time of time again .
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be efficient .
let &apos;s call the animal catcher , it costs a lot of money .
so in other words , i first want to do what i want .
so , there &apos;s programs that can be the most warm-grade number .
but i really believe that , after we &apos;ll get something else .
and here &apos;s the &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have learned as a lawyer , by the way .
so , this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
but what this picture is , what this picture is .
they typically take software in the rule for a few years .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
secondly , the same thing is that they have the same repuling of these same renotation .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
if you do not do that , you can take someone away .
and it &apos;s solmentally solined , of course .
and you can see , these aren &apos;t three of these three images .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we &apos;re protecting our communities .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
turned out the garbage heap . went home .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i sell showers in the entire country , around the world .
i hope you &apos;ll be pleased to look for it .
you know , we hear a whole bunch about transparency .
play is the tickt that keeps us .
i &apos;ve had two turnons in most of my activities .
is it more comfortable for others or is it about it ?
our gut is a wonderful fevely environment for these bacteria .
these are the kinds of questions we need to be able to face .
if you have to give something , give it right now .
and no , it &apos;s not , you know , you &apos;re san francisco .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
and i can tell you , it was a experience of experience .
under a hat i &apos;m in the history of anatomy .
and that &apos;s why the testical stage is concerned .
we produce androids , and we respond to androgens .
if you haven &apos;t moved yet , you &apos;ve buried it .
now in practice , people are not testing people to test their chromosome .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently ?
you can always look really great for less than 50 dollars .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we eating from our memories ?
and my talk today is mainly about this cognitive cognitive act .
the first of those fall is a discrastered , complexity .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
most of them are going to be completely ignored by remembering themselves .
we think about our future as a premoncient memories .
when you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to get somebody &apos;s happy people .
it was an extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with online play .
you never get a job you can &apos;t solve .
we &apos;re developing a collaborative , much of our own world .
and these were the first of people designed playing playing devices .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
there is a huge wave of interest among professionals among the modern explorers .
now , in this area there &apos;s not a couple thousand targets .
the idea is to list a digital security system .
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and if it wasn &apos;t , then it &apos;s nothing .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
probably what they did probably did , even the coffee size of the machine interface .
so here you see a clip from this founking code .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
but i &apos;ve given my ego in my ego .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine .
you could also use ordinary bram-technology technology .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
you &apos;ll see all the time in the movie .
i don &apos;t know how to be a mobile maintenance people .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
there are a couple of places that we can turn forward to .
you can move inside and do different kinds of experience .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
well , we know all about where things are coming from .
but we just know about where things go .
but actually , this night was a better fun .
it &apos;s a real 3d scan and a movement recording .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
the revelation was a part of life .
this is the average size of a giant iceberg .
and i was like , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
you go to the block , take it as a surgery .
one of my friends did it -- richard chingaus .
the only problem with this was they had 10 children .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat is 300 .
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s in the rest of the five .
i went through my way home .
and that was the first time i learned this firsthand .
and she said the three words : remember you remember ?
both the cases were done , and they were doing well .
both of the time i &apos;m saying , they answered me .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
this is technology energized innovation .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
it &apos;s new genes have already been on the way , nano-materials .
i know now that it was the bottom of the sea .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
certification users are hacking and pramy cards .
in essence , the field was building the field of time .
and within a few years , lego , every household .
a few years ago , i started developing a lot of this .
as they do , we can predict the structure and function .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i was staring at it .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard .
and more and more people would come in , simply because they were angry .
in many areas , people were afraid of lynchgenic .
it was the fear of terror , who shaped her life .
and of course it can never give you more . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go into injustice .
because ultimately our humanity depends from our humanity .
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet .
when somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
sometimes i get the balance . it &apos;s a story .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
the cost of solar water was about 50 percent last year .
it &apos;s our survival to survival .
56 percent of the rape &apos;s break-bound cases don &apos;t come back at the court .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
a 6 er of change is unstopped .
i love this one : &quot; watson stupid of human biases . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the more nunuarity of language .
it &apos;s about creating scarce goods of abundance .
but the king of sisibut got established .
so , just pull off and start invent .
and the set was one of the scruping-off of the ship &apos;s set of the ship .
our imagination is a force that even can make an actual reality .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
so , when i was 15 , i decided to be in the shoes .
this was not a film , no hd , that was real .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
so , that really got me , and i wanted to do more .
he said , &quot; we build monoac- , not intensely .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago to do miguel .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of anyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that can lower it to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
usually you &apos;re just going to be next to some people , some of them .
because when the water blows out , it goes into the atlantic .
what we need are many companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
yes , this is what you see there is the burden down there .
and then we started to negotiate with the cheral .
the human being is from the apes or a common ancestor .
and she asked him what was your hobbies ?
you feel , this is the real truth behind the rendering .
here you need some logic , but also to lie .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
and uranium is being taken in more than a candle , a little bit like a candle .
they did that by putting the land wateating .
and then you can see , the enormous amount of scale there are .
so that first one , that &apos;s more like a passionate affman .
and that food allodes of output to one , he said .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
that second fish , this is another kind of love story .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
there was a way of lauding the piano there yet .
i know what people think when they see this .
okay , let me just brack a little blood for you .
we can do this time machine all the way , whatever we want .
and when i turn around , the fingers changes its position .
now , what does this have done with placebo attacking placebo effect ?
but a white tablet isn &apos;t as good as a blue pill .
it turns out that &apos;s not all that &apos;s all of them .
tell me not to say these things don &apos;t have consequences .
what about the baby paralysis ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
we &apos;ll be going to meet a few times .
these are actual patients who perform an awful more time-processing procedure .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds of their pain .
it &apos;s a eyeeye of life , one after one .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
and then people could get the food and they would not be blind .
i wonder you &apos;re often wrong to do all sorts of things .
and this is the value of this experience , this as plain as that simple practice .
so there &apos;s better to be a nine on the beginning of my death death .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution to the waste .
and this is a thought of the thought that i think appropriate .
usually most people start to raise themselves in terms of their task .
they invest together in the space of a lot of time in the collapsing .
specialized skills and skills and the combination of success to success .
if we go back from there , what would the 2020 be show ?
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are more proxy .
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
you can just name a couple of names , and people will get to understand .
i mean , you know , you can choose your shoes .
has one in the audience ever die of mases of the shrimp ?
and also , what you thought about today is what you think about today .
that meant that he was ever killed during the chinese invasion .
so , i ask , how do i do that ?
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you on this journey .
it means that we have an cultural impact next to the scientific .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life work .
please follow me , because the circle will come again .
when your work happened -- not entirely your mistake , right ?
so people in the west have been thinking about creativity .
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
in fact , sometimes it can feel a paranormal feeling .
she said it was like a ththy train .
and i guess many of you have done it .
this is one of the most painful approaches of a creative life .
and the predictions of how they read it are serious .
the last september last year , the machine was the first time .
the first market is new to accept reality . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
financial depression exploded in the industrial world over the last generation .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
and i think it &apos;s the way that the world looks like this .
most people know this from a global field .
that &apos;s the publication that we just finished just recently .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is a piece of indense chemical material .
so , this looks like a basketball patpola .
you see the top field that his chromosome will just fall apart .
this is in our entire country of america in america .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book .
it &apos;s a whole thing that is beautiful in life .
the things that are used to go into technical systems .
here &apos;s the fact that men are not pigs .
here it says , the more you get it , the better .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and take the nutrients .
this is , of course , intensive agriculture , but the plants are carrying themselves .
and in general , it &apos;s all about what the right thing is .
and as we grow older , we &apos;re getting bigger .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
interpresions are the written notes of the songs of music .
the record tracks the function of a script .
you studied the works he took and after .
i play the suggestion of what these notes might have to be .
to keep about hazpraches , right with the composer .
that &apos;s , you know , in the front line .
and sound and regulate , f and b , etc .
and also today we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
and they made that something called the lem maps .
i think that somehow six-shy-cent dollars or something like that .
so , i think it &apos;s a very , very inconvenient hack .
and i think technology will always become more important in modern societies .
and that &apos;s the core concerns of the biohackers .
and these are now the biohacker , the individual people .
and i think there was a really good code , i think .
but also our perception , as hardel makes us as well .
that means you &apos;re navigated through sounds and about rhythm .
we &apos;ve moved on this in the vogage age .
and other examples are the ambit , intelligent systems .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
now , not to the local level , but it &apos;s on a global level .
so you can ask : how happy is the life self ?
&quot; because she said that morning , &quot; she said .
and the other thing is , mother mother today is in the fourth or five .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video uploaded you .
now there are 10,000 paroaries of the end of youtube .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure to do something , we do it .
the words , as long as his friends , the braveals , now .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
car colors , paints color from the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
they have to make 62 different decisions to try to really try to make their car completely .
it doesn &apos;t make it possible to say the picture was brought .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
and over 10,000 of dying have already been aped in the netherlands .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
you &apos;ve got to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities .
and indeed , we &apos;re also a multicellous community .
50 percent of your decisions were found within nine minutes or less .
it was a store that was called the kite .
i mean , this is just what my logical side is .
i was preparing on a talk on tedglobal .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders with a corporation .
do you know how many choices do you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you have to meet ?
the invention of language was a small step into that direction .
this is a very counterintuitive exercise scheme .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limitations . &quot;
they always care that they lose the mermaid .
okay . so , anyone who &apos;s going to assume , gary &apos;s takes on the supply of the supply .
because the categories say i can keep them apart .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; sync . &quot;
and each beings uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
so that means that the players beat three of the emails .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
8 : tsunameswarning . 9 : cyberattacks : cyber attacks .
recession , standomomday , egypt . dooliday . egypt .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
in 2010 , we had just been engaged on two billion people online .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s all sorts of possibilities .
a few months went over and i was just forgotten everything .
i sent them home without my high doctor to talk with my high doctor .
and if you do refine , and never do the mistake again .
it turns out he &apos;s infection .
some of my fonble ones happened in the last five years .
and the fish also had the good thing to be there .
we &apos;ve gotten distracted by the rhetoric of the rhetoric of the punishment .
but what if you want to see the pink buttons ?
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia , as a slaves .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i found that technology should be possible , and not kill .
so you have to smooth the ipad , and these are the fireflies out there .
and we bring them back , in a century history for children .
she was a tafery , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really .
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
i had a 14 year-old , poor black boys as the clients .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
i think that there are fundamentally a lot of change for the world .
innovation , creativity , and development , not just come from our heads .
we want to fight prebias and discrimination in criminal justice system .
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self .
well , where would you figure your brain on this scale ?
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl , it looks like a girl .
and so they &apos;re really keen to do the future civil rights movement .
oh malguisi : mark , mark , come back .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the old-growth forest .
i think it more like it more , right ?
just when it doesn &apos;t work , it may be the most roilty .
and as a general term , we can use the word of certainty .
he said , &quot; stop , you have to go to the house .
there are 68 million people who are in the world who are carrying in a wheelchair .
i mean , what does anybody bring up with so much outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought up with .
i &apos;ve brought seven pieces of pants , and that &apos;s it .
and i &apos;m really going to show you my outfits of this past week .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
if we start to start cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes back from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
that &apos;s what politics , i think , in the years .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i know i &apos;m performing computer games .
and i don &apos;t just mean that not only do it .
how can we recreate these feelings of play into the reality ?
ok , imagine how extreme self-empowerment .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
in front of these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep skoors .
i &apos;m going to argue that we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
and thank god i was not using a st-dictionary at that time .
or do you want to be more profitable , more force .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
so think of this as a visual point .
when we looked at how feelings we varied with income .
an eight more powerful , playful . how is your brand ?
we went to sao paulo , where the outdoor sales had been banned .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
and we actually show all the process of how it works .
and just so disappeared all of these companies , one after one .
and what is noticing , was that i needed a fellow a fellow .
this is what i did . the first image is a picture of my family .
and if it are vulnerable , really bad things can happen .
and guess what we found in the line of the code ?
this is just a period of two and a half weeks .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
let &apos;s click , and rums , you &apos;re in this museum .
when the museum gave us the picture , we click it on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
so all of these green areas , these are the ultimate environments .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again , back in new york .
think about it , it &apos;s free , none of us earned it in it .
and that urgency , this purpose , has really changed my life .
imagine that every single one of human being is being controlled .
we want to use that as a kind of impulse for the flywater .
they interact in clear ways with their environment and their experience .
we have lost his bed so he can see the outside .
that keeps us on the end and we &apos;re going to continue to continue on it .
imagine that the computer points could really start flying .
this centrifutinine in iran are in 15 acres .
i didn &apos;t have two years of my wife talking with my wife .
almost like we prepare our lives on this long day .
and i &apos;m eating , i &apos;m making a little kid .
they knew any bits and bybyties that had to attack them .
looks pretty much like an init-like language .
then they wanted to kill them because you could eat them well .
and they &apos;re just going to get the only remains of the limb remains .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
because of ocean areas , we basically have the past back .
there was gray whales a long time ago , 500 years ago .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of digototar .
in these records , there was a cabinet called the finc .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , the lego came out .
wfully brown is electronic modules that have a specific function .
but wait for this , you wait , this is my favorite project .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
i asked him how he was a lump of fish .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t do sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask .
let &apos;s call him guguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
this is a fish cut in the south western corner of spain .
well , they couldn &apos;t make any good that this was not profitable .
because a good engineer is actually built out of a great cars or nuclear power .
and also , among the other hand , these other procedures add each other .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-recapitalized .
she &apos;s the last renedle before something in the body .
look at teenage , farmers like miguel .
and who &apos;s going to see that this is true in men .
but even in this very limited view , we can do a lot of things .
the brown system is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of cost for a cost of fame .
and as i say the word justice , it &apos;s this uncomfortable feeling .
and he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m at the fire guard .
no more necessary , a song or to sing .
whether the music is able to improvise or too sweet .
now , why am i asking from my audience now , that it &apos;s also going to be active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art you never saw has no power .
no loud , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
because he doesn &apos;t know what kind of pile he should go from first .
i want to tell you now what we found in my institute .
so this is a three-sentence piece of logic .
because to lie that they can just be able to play these logic just wrong .
the first sentence is flapping out , there &apos;s no soul .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just .
and from here , i can get to the site and recasfy it again .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet for dance .
a deception becomes something done , because somebody manages it to you .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
she wouldn &apos;t be treated by child paralysis . no way .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis , and you know what ?
we love to dive up in lie . we love that .
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust in the system .
he liberating us from one of the worst spirit of humanity .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t connect the cause and the correlation .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
and you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who are of both has more ? &quot;
from the living self , it has a very bad time time .
well , the two types of self drop two terms of happiness .
we know a little bit about what the happiness happiness is .
no fear , no torg , baby paralysis , shut .
now , how do you start talking about music &apos;s language ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
in many , you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
and the mood of your team is more important than any of the beaudied of the world .
no major endeavor , innovation magazine , was ever taken on risk .
co2 warural the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it turns out the question is , whether you can get that down to zero .
now , i wondered how can i really get this really cool ?
and we were a whole family for a moment and four and a half years to a right family .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
but as they talked to various people of the world , they have spoken on these possibilities .
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
the error is doing the error , and you pay a lot later .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it is .
so i offered a 10000-dollar prize of software for the winner .
the tune comes out of the healthy gene and the rhythm from the dance .
but the waama is not only killed the spear .
you learn the notes to come to the user on the instrument .
but even in my cuy-white animals sometimes , i have this thing .
so , is conbling , as i could just write a song ?
it surrounded blue because of the genes we &apos;ve put in .
now , they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol &quot; which is just a bad experiment .
it &apos;s turning carbon dioxide into methane under the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
but the question i want to flip up is : why not ?
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
i started thinking , i should just just think of the project .
it &apos;s still going on for your contribution there .
i believe it &apos;s and i feel that we should teach this .
the andean is the most potent source of this one that is the safety of this city .
but if they start filling up , most of the water will be thrown away .
this is not a electron microshot ; it &apos;s a regular microscope .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most important problem .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control the biodiversity of all of the genetics .
this is a whole book , an example of not imaging data .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
christianity , islam , buddhism , pachycephalosaurus , and whatever .
it &apos;s not going to make any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
the father of this young man was identified as followers of the pander .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is hardly 300 years old .
so the alliance for climate protection has started to live .
should i have this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
this is btouched house from capo house . every column is a chapter .
oversustaining the picture of nasa &apos;s work .
now , this is even on the internet now . you can check it .
but the spatial orientation is actually in fact meaning .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we need modern progress .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow of the sierra leone .
but at the same time , they had a clear sense of the forest , which was amazing .
because the france could be the best to come back and get the phosphorus back .
and we &apos;re going to replace the oil we can replace with other energy power .
and this is the projection of vision , feedback , see .
so , for example , i &apos;m the environment , getting a less car .
we could reduce this for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
so the question is , how do we go with these wind ?
so we don &apos;t have to control the people &apos;s best to be more likely to be very bad .
and these two worlds are all coking , new and old thinking .
so i engaged on , when is , of course , or intuitively .
if you get the wrong things away , you have a problem problem .
so , they &apos;re helping with this , ask them , ask people to do things .
so also , in any store you can get the things back .
so , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all get involved .
what were his kind of the circumstances , how the society and politics ?
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is the sighted thing .
then the same thing happens like a good , condenbalanced conversation .
the interesting thing is , if i can do a little trip .
and the key tool of information training has been a story for me since goodbye .
you put it in it with a particular tone and tends it to the dial .
and then we &apos;ve been working on a cobonation of property .
so the device you see here , this hasn &apos;t worked .
and what &apos;s interesting is that also , in southeast asia .
and partly with these hacker spaces , which is , in some places , put together there .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
and this is the one i had last half of a year .
it goes on to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
so unfortunately , unfortunately , we have failed a bit of a path to virtual fusion .
what does impact on our minds and our memory capacity ?
and what &apos;s honesty is extreme , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and with some kind of a lamp , we can see virtual worlds visible .
we know that money is very important , and goals are very important .
and you can do that by using these sorts of ways , but also through crowdsourcing .
but where was the next guinea thing to help this patient ?
three things : tastemaker , the manque community , and the unexpected .
&quot; nyan cat is animation and music in final loop .
and we are all feeling at all as treasled of our original culture .
for example , this was been recorded in a standtrip .
this is my wlan-scale . a very simple thing .
when i finish with the simple finish , i am learning how to choose .
every single harvard staff now takes under a lifetime course of life .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done an effort in the netherlands .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we know nine cities now , and we &apos;re now seeing this app .
and these guys know something that we have lost out of the eyes .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
every single one of you could be a lot of time on the internet to the next saturday .
this is a slide which i would suggest from my publication .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do . we &apos;re looking right right here into the center here .
just trade the building of homes to cities .
why is it important to re-launch , what represents the red ?
a large load of wages , so we will welcome the risk of the risk .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points of data , i think .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to do the experiments .
these little oil droplet were in the sense that the most primitive cell form .
and we found that in fact there was a correlation .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this on our country &apos;s head ? &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
a million people every year latin america , and go into the united states .
how good do you think you &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re doing decisions ?
this is a business swap system , it was almost like a great public treatment .
and what &apos;s below is that what we call the bureaucracy .
fifth of all : brand alcohol firm , wrote on .
how about a sentence of new , never heard of hearing .
how about owners that we don &apos;t even make us a can ?
and bryan , you really have a string here .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our hep detection .
the basis of this is technologies , and these are potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially potentially .
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in health .
by 2020 , we &apos;re looking at two billion internet users .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in the courom ? &quot;
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors &apos; wrings and down .
do you know how to call a 300ter in major league baseball ?
and i was good , i was at the porch .
and it worked for a long time , until i met a printer .
and when i listened to her , she made my uugled sound .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent violence has not changed very much .
so maybe you &apos;d like to put yourself a little bit of the interview . &quot;
this map grows and it &apos;s sensing to the discoming of the book .
i say that because i think that identity is very important .
because your life depended on that you did the job right .
this piece of 50 year-old technology was the magical thing for me .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds , sounds .
i &apos;m going to go to khoya , an interactive architectural app .
fantasy ybooks always have maps , but these maps were static .
we have a lot of cells that are not alone alone .
and then i went from my car and i went to the court .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in standhistold and in prison .
we all have to believe very at all , very important , that we can &apos;t see .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make it very , very tired . &quot;
i &apos;m proposing these kids who were sentat the very rough meal .
how can a judge turn a little , he &apos;s not ?
what is the idea and feelings about yourself ?
this is a photographer m.toff of the photographer mitoledano .
i like many black colors , many gray notes and such a stuff .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is the game .
to adapt to a decent world , we need to play .
when we look at the foresession , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took me 13 years .
it surprised not that these destruction also have the survival of bonobos .
bonobos -- how people -- love their lives , they love to play their lives .
so sex games are spread , both in bonobos and in humans .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat in his hotel room .
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in form species ?
as a consequence , the body evolves more than the typical female trajectory .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of intersexuality .
and our nation really focused on a very romantic concept of individualism .
and i had to explain the journalist that it wasn &apos;t there .
in our places , we &apos;re going to go in all kinds of unintellige-of-kinds of remorse .
wouldn &apos;t you want to do that in their genes ?
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and i tend to think of them as my shadow .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
so this allows together to play the inout of ties , trust and other .
they &apos;re going to create an ep-to-the-world source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
we play games to escape the suffering of the physical world .
and i hope that you will design with me and play with me .
that &apos;s what we call real design .
ah , the majority . the lle i like to see as a doctor .
we land one human being for our society .
so , again , change and customization are the greatest skills of people .
now , if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
which would you like to have , if you could just have one ?
a few . probably like a creative crowd here .
we find other strange self-interest to what their rights are .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
and this gave us great confidence for what we were looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , didn &apos;t just get that way .
it &apos;s the kind of complex circle of that i &apos;d like to tell you about today .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
i was the only one to speak with the airplane .
i was given the miracle of being dying that day .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic panel .
and neither the machine leaders , the security system will notice .
we need to turn the consequences , and we &apos;re starting better .
but even apart , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
these are people being connected to coternity -- forever .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
temple it is going to be part of the show , which is pretty wodious .
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
you see the person who asks what happens inside the inside .
he picks about 120 foot off the water , or 40 feet .
season , people make a little call , go to the bathroom .
well , that night , that night , everybody went to celebrate the center .
but this is happening in a lot of endless transport and more complex things .
they cause whatever a water ball with a piece of water is water .
and we got the assignment of designing a building at the center of the expo .
this would call you , in engineering , a real-time system .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to his hospital room .
my life is really extraordinary about work in some amazing projects .
temple it was one of the leading graffiti artists in the &apos; 80s .
anybody that movie or padge &quot; saw it &quot; ?
so we created a device that is completely free from limitations .
and all the paralyzed can actually communicate alone with its eyes or draw .
you say , you &apos;re saying that you will never forget the names of those who will never be counted .
there &apos;s times before , the way that the verteototar is .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to get worse .
we &apos;ve run chilsighted canits on children , and we see it playing with it .
lights , sounds , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
they add a blue blue and they can make light on a green , and they can make light .
and the best part of this is that they connect with magnets .
but there is a key difference : the transistor was only in the expert .
concrete blocks were the most vulnerable building unit in the world .
i looked into rabs , and it was a little bit pink pink .
and i gave him a file for penicillin and sent him to .
because it &apos;s called a little advance that has lost that way .
this is the tremendous amount of role that a marine reserve can play .
so it &apos;s nothing that has changed , and yet it changed .
let me close with three of my own words : i still remember .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians , he &apos;s dying of all kinds of errors .
he had a potentially potentially contractable condition called egletis .
it &apos;s a hummer of dough , the fear of the darkness .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular time frame .
here &apos;s the crux of the whole demonstration that i kept talking about .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical manic graph at age .
and if we can do this for raw data , why can &apos;t it be content ?
that &apos;s just when you step back , and you look at this whole thing .
so we can jump through and look at all the ted prize winner .
and so i want to show you something else , which might be a very surprising one .
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
we are not a realistic , we enjoy it . we are lover .
and that &apos;s what i think it was pretty good for at that science fiction .
but secretly , i wanted to go down to the real wreck of the titanic .
well , they were also very advanced and capable of doing more options .
and i &apos;m going to fly through a little robotic experience through the ship .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on sunlight , as we do .
that &apos;s what &apos;s taken on two billion years of labor .
nasa has one of the one of the one sentence : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
so here &apos;s a company that was trying to do it right .
and then he added , &quot; we are basically a world .
in that rooms , three of the households are waiting forever .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
if you tear it down down , it &apos;s a little bit long .
so the ininininine reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and we can turn two milliseconds in a space valve , and we can turn out a square shift with this big battery .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation , in the rich world .
&quot; we are losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
so i rang up the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
he came up on the table with a light white color .
who can make a fish so tasty after it was being loaded ?
it &apos;s near the breadalalalagr .
they grow on the ground , which is basically the wetlands .
i didn &apos;t know much about leadership before i was running this zone .
there &apos;s the real research facility in letsdel .
we &apos;re not asking between the things we choose . we choose to choose between memories of experiences .
well , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re actually a half and a half .
it &apos;s not about genes to move around ; it &apos;s not about chemicals .
there &apos;s in the present tense , but we have an incredible opportunity .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician &apos;s trick .
or , &quot; what was your trip to albth ? &quot; or something like that .
and they &apos;re very , very important , and that &apos;s the case dominated .
so that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars in the dark to the next green .
he was developed with a few other people who &apos;ve developed a rotivirus vaccine .
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for eye is a pretty complicated process .
they were playing for 18 years , we play in a quality of comedy for 16 years .
it &apos;s a online game where you have to get through an oil scarcity .
if you could only have one of these , it would be a whole other world .
he &apos;s a gorgeous padwise , lovely girl .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
if i don &apos;t have it right , the canananilis is not a man .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to go into this machine .
i really think that &apos;s not a wishtest , and no , it &apos;s not a wishbook .
i &apos;ve been time , geographic , fusion and biofuels .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can convince him .
and it &apos;s there , and there are pow60 years , and it &apos;s done .
so construction figures this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterative process .
and with each attempt , the children get feedback feedback , and what &apos;s not .
every americans americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quick .
and soon this , i wrote an article about genetic food .
we type , we pass one , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
these were people , educated people , decent people .
studies have been done to see if that was true .
studies of studies are done ; this is a serious business .
i worked in collegically working on the collective , and that was grassroots democratic .
all cultures have involved up on the dance with new life .
because , in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul , or not .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
it turns out he wanted to find on top of the sickers .
this is the kanunt , suyod river in southwest greenland .
the united states is one of the two largest bombers , along with china .
he &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s kind of a meressiness , and it &apos;s a laborant .
so let &apos;s do a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
the first market with 100 percent clean electricity is new , within the next 10 years .
this is not at all as my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i find it better if we &apos;re encouraging our big creative practices .
each , it has four different variations -- you can select that you want to use .
this actually took a two-thousand actually really , really , two thousand actually , these networks .
so this is just one use of many , you can do it .
and then the security fills between the phrases of open and citizen science .
i wrote four words , and i &apos;d like to just explain to you .
it &apos;s okay . the question is , how is it that we &apos;re going to get us ?
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , and it &apos;s clear .
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that does not too much .
i could not have done it better . i didn &apos;t have it .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
and the mapping is one of the really aggressive applications for technology like this .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was right now .
but how about it , if the picture you put on all your images ?
you &apos;ve rented your phone . they didn &apos;t bought it .
and look how we process information , how do we use information ?
people said , eh , you don &apos;t have any fear of being successful ?
so is it clear that the answer to the question is they &apos;re .
these organisms can grow up fully , they can actually live in a vacuum .
to put it in my relationship : i was born in the year in 1946 .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
which , in fact , the language of subunderunderled .
we also did something about the corner of this particular case of the guardian .
listen to that and say , if you taste it or not .
i say , &quot; ultical , what do you need to do so n a car ?
he asked me what the prescripces of this adventure for me was .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ve got this new thing .
if the error is done , the students get the next difficult piece .
the continonics that you had now with music is not because it &apos;s not possible .
but you say , please don &apos;t understand , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
the composer is becoming more to a friend of mine .
the work of the inaring is a bit more similar to the actual theater .
the spanish painter abablo picasso once did her portraits .
one day , this shape , yes , there &apos;s a little bit more risky .
it likes to be very like this , because he has a prodelance of sincerity .
this little bub that doesn &apos;t have to delete the fire .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not done by stop , physical nature .
all of this is influenced me and all that implies my experience of the composition .
and if i &apos;m right , the cananananstic man is a man .
you can only have nulehydrations unless you &apos;re there .
we do in brazil where we regain the nutrients .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first thing .
you can only be carbon neutral , if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon area .
you &apos;ve heard about a surplus problem of trees from trees ?
it &apos;s safe to be safe , which is oil consumption .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the point of letters is you only realize when you can get language to this .
right , we can get rid of this way of nutrients in agriculture .
that &apos;s six to 20 countries that control 40 percent of the oil supplies .
a woman in germany is about six shma three pounds in her lifetime .
and i &apos;m not so sure you &apos;re really standing on the front of the turtle .
and that &apos;s because of the letters you learned to paint .
but there is a third way to have a compelling , fascinating and scary possibility .
in the short time there , i came up with a sense of ted : ted has an identity .
she said , &quot; honor &quot; ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and that next steps , like electronics , seem to take few decades .
i don &apos;t know what each individual has in the plural machine .
we came to conclusion that magic and magic were replaced with machines .
a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey . &quot;
and that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency is growing in the supply .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very seriously .
and i want to look at this on the scale of the world on earth .
of course my grandmother would say , they were something special .
but somehow we make it to make us feel like we can .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
they come from ideas that are being driven by the worvors in our hearts .
so this allows us to do it again as a unified organism .
and so i think the ted community is tade him .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and these apps , we use our hands to improve our communities .
but this is actually completely composed of this picture , and it &apos;s actually composed of different places .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve been familiar with 4,000 followers who have twitter .
and they realized that the city was actually being made to get rid of these fire hydrant .
you &apos;re going to be to shock him for the window .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
this is not a politically active thing , this is office cratic .
now , why do we see graphs in technology on the logarithmic logarithmic work ?
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve citizenship .
so i &apos;m going to start to show you a quick boring slide .
in other words , every step here is in the standard scale .
and even a little bit more disturbing , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit about paper here .
as a young lawyer hater , i was the great privilege to meet the pink parks .
so it &apos;s more about trying to capture an idea , actually , as a moment .
the reason for this : the government could trace back where a text came from .
it shows us an unprecedented , what happens when governments get into their own citizens .
basically the sea &apos;s bottom comes to the bottom of the deck and then thrown back .
they were not eaten , you ate them because they were dead .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they also had to register a sheet with an unprecedented text in the writer .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
and that &apos;s one of the three main sources of the existing sectors of today today .
what you need is a environment that you can do it .
they sold this program for 280,000 euros for the egyptian government .
they &apos;re prefabricated , light , sound , engine and sensor and the sensor .
and the simple process goes out , is a little bit of a powerful fact .
the idea behind the logoundogic , is that it &apos;s a growing library .
until in the &apos; 80s , he was being used in big style .
and at night , the monk came and said he had to get the cog .
16 terawatts of energy , all the eight minutes , hung on the earth &apos;s earth .

but in fact , i &apos;ve been announcing on the center of the future , in the end of the future , is exactly the opposite .
you know , according to arthur clarke , the law are advanced technology and magic no more than any other thing .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely known children &apos;s book .
now , you might think that all of the sudden you would have to do have all of the sudden of categories like me .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are so problematic and questionable .
and if you think that you &apos;re not looking at something very well , you probably have a right .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , with the idea of changing our environment and guide it .
now the first project i &apos;d like to show is actually one of the first in our lab .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of mankind .
at home , new york , i &apos;m ceo of the millennium department organization called robin hood .
i &apos;m not trying to have a job anymore ; i &apos;m going to make it happy to be happy .
while we diminished , i was having this feeling , man , to die is not scary .
and it seemed to have been a little bit like , with these gray boxes , this real-time control control system .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others might be met by stuxnet .
i worked with people with dwarfisfish-growing -- so people who were smaller than common .
i certainly would never get a alien world with an room , and it seemed quite unlikely to me .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , so the effect of this is being to be the impact of a human being .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been looking at my legs and not even of that experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in these words , and how we build these values .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on the whole range of human possibilities .
and i &apos;m turning around and i &apos;m watching these older man , and i have no idea who he is .
when i first saw her , i put it out of my own belly . &quot;
we know that we are hardwired to be human being , if we do hard , really passionate work .
let &apos;s start looking at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moault &quot; in the u.s.
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s just floating , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;ll just give you all of the nutrients that you would just want to do with an effort on it .
they help in the didive of environmental nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but at the time , as a multi-cellous organisms , things began to change .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
but what &apos;s interesting is the crux of the poem , the rhythm of the dance , in every culture .
and to this day today , i have the deepest sense of what i see in my back .
and the stakes are an example of a new generation of help to the table digital data .
and in this archaian models , we &apos;re in essentially natural ratio to the virtuality .
but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i &apos;m going to ask myself , why ?
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just a 40 years old .
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative return .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a pen .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the hell with you .
he lives in the deep sea about a half-and-a-mile deep , in almost boiling water temperatures .
we have the ability to build a large robot that can make the millions of chromosomes a day .
the interesting thing is , at that time , the same time was the media community and medium itself .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about romanity .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual consciousness as a real habitat .
the reason for the designers that have the first semester of the first semester , the great designs .
so , this first impression is going on in a rasant speed speed , as we perceive things .
i think that this can be changed by raising things in the suburbs .
and that &apos;s a very intuitive thing to do for us , when i don &apos;t have to think about it very much .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to .
we use this great eureka phemishemism , trying to try and make it a perfectly .
the family , the fear of their life , he would take him all the other tools and all the tools .
what we &apos;re trying to do in national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies together .
and if you say , &quot; if you &apos;re a doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
im : so i sort of interact with the object again , again , zoom in , zoom in .
now i have argued that this is not the constantion -- this is based on a three-billion years of evolution .
and i want to say that there were some choices , but not all was a choice of choice .
if you break the gold fish glass so that everything is possible , you get your satisfaction .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genomic , the genomic genome .
recently , i &apos;ve talked to the oil industry and they said they would just understand this model .
think about it : we have a four-page code : a , c , g and t.
that &apos;s all that has a lot of useful investment , but it &apos;s also much better .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture is found to be able to use the material world .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , then it &apos;s like a stealth system .
and you really have to stay pretty hard , but i think it &apos;s going to be true .
so we pretend it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
because he led them to a red , he didn &apos;t reach himself .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts of electrical power are built on diesel ground on diesel ground .
of course , you can only get this kind of thing if you &apos;re in some way .
and let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can &apos;t solve the technical problem .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a school , and she told a student .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man .
nathanide manam transformed into understanding in a steady curiosity and courage .
even better , he was in aquacacal for the ceo of sustainability in sustainability .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the oceans as we have gotten out of the world .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you do , what is sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that is incredible .
and the third set that immediately comes out of people who have a strong sense of soul .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a narrow area .
and that &apos;s half of all the contents of the world that are being created by the textile industry .
in open bach , for example , it &apos;s 20 percent of the trash crowd in the stream .
that means that all of our intelligence means we want to be a little slmber than trees , right ?
and they &apos;re designed to do so , through the design that a farmer just can &apos;t grow .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 17 percent of the phosphorus world &apos;s phosphorus worldwide .
every point where you diverded away , you will get to life again .
in the last 20 years , the five doutons of uranium in the world in germany has been distributed .
and the child plays , after a memorial , instead of a red flower , instead of a red flower .
so no longer saving , let alone , decrease , decrease , no guilt , but intelligent waste .
now , it &apos;s a very strange thing for salmon , but what we do with our music language .
so for the course of music , for the same time , you need to be in the same time for the spoken language .
one example of a whole range of mine : bells the sea &apos;s erotic mark made .
but then i &apos;d be regret because music is a beautiful , communictive thing .
we need digital security systems , where a human machine doesn &apos;t really respond enough .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with them , it was hard to get their attention .
you have to make the wind from the wind , you can send it away and read the rest of the ark .
in this country , for children , for children , for children , there are survival of life without tondation .
one policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
she said , &quot; the first thing that says you will love your mama . &quot;
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us up .
as a doctor , you can do good things . as a care doctor , you can do more .
so , steve pinker has shown us that we are currently living in a very peaceful time of human history .
i felt it was like our little bits of clocks and cameras all over the way .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
we say , &quot; computers , generic , make a hundred million random factors of inrees .
and because that is so , there was a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
and they developed special structures that did nothing but to process information within the organism .
when he saw me , he came down to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
what they did was they were good in a paper with a crstatic thought , they could find the creators of that idea .
and over time , we &apos;re going to focus on large animals and in the ocean that are the big fish .
unemployment is a full job certificate in the netherlands -- or was it .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the most challenging thing , one opinion , or through your audience .
the second largest group that we see today are not driven by money .
is that really , so that means we &apos;re right here right now in the right right here .
so here , i think the arts and the film may fill the gap and simulations .
this is why the dome of the washington ton comes from aluminum to be made .
and over the next eight or nine days , they gave birth to their esteemed .
and it showed that today , the human pattern can actually go into the proteins as the best superline .
although aluminum is the 3 percent of the earth , it &apos;s not a pure metal .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of explosion .
either &quot; flsa fusion or a paradise wind , &quot; you &apos;re going to have a choice .
so i want to talk to you about what might be , this transition in that we &apos;re currently in .
and also recently , a study of ceos in the field where they &apos;ve been watching the ceos for weeks .
you already have a building site ; it &apos;s already about this area for the second city .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to leave it .
and then we looked at what was more people , which people would say , would say , a glass of marry .
and they &apos;ve found that an average ceo of ceo is on 139 tasks .
this graph shows how it looked like the video that the video showed last summer .
or even duckingly , of these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
there was a parody for the first seven days , a parody for each birthday .
and i &apos;ve come to the core line that a new city gives people new opportunities .
you hear a lot about how mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
so , for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a timeline on top of the mall .
and she makes a cross-vertpin ? are they something that &apos;s going to make the blood in the trunk .
michael j. nelson : the path program for the table program was a very good joke to twitter .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work .
we developed an app for layar , augmented reality , to find these aeds .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people , and to help themselves and to help .
it has an app , a web and hand-spouse , called &quot; citizens connect . &quot;
they are incredibly frustrated with her , but complain not to fix them .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the radical form .
if you do that , you can name it a name , and he called the first disease .
she opened a computer business , and then a cosmetitan and a nurse came on .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects fail .
so to get a more realistic conclusion , i &apos;ve seen it , so i &apos;ve got to go out of planning .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape of landscape , and the bottom figure is being manipulated .
add this buzzer for a more added effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
if you have 10 teams , typical , typical , you get about six who have robust structures .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or pose , building the right prototype .
when countries get together in places like skeletons like skeletons , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
this is kind of the deadline , which has been , the environmental models that we have to hold .
as peter said , not only does they produce the highest towers of the rainforest , but also the most interesting structures of all .
and that is that blenl students were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and the team that goes on and on work is the performance of the team of the team .
one is energy density that these technologies are increasing dramatically than the power of power .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even have to leave the glass .
and the lesson i think i think the construction is is a symbolic sport .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are profit from the scientific method .
people are turning themselves in their own , and they &apos;re so tightly so prolific that you can &apos;t free them .
we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress , like earlier .
echinaca , a small antioxidanine , that helps you go back the license .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of column , often like traveling a lot of wave of reactor .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this thing , and that robbers , like flies .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
or better , how can we create conditions that can empower each community ?
that means that 15 pounds of wildfish is required to get a pound .
and that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is that a sustainable protein ?
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of competence that &apos;s used to take him around the tanzanian giraffe .
they do this because they can follow the last white line of the landstreet in northern 92 .
so we also understand each other , i &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
almost every manufacturing method of crossing electricity is the co2 , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
capital , chemistry and machines are at state-of-the-art level , and it never creates a really good thing to eat .
i put my backpassport in a pool of + &apos;s in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , but unlike our own , unvarably , human imagination .
and i noticed how much of these blestark stops , of an space mission .
and this is what you see here that are just next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and quickable itself to us that it can afford .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit about a little bit very much of celliest .
our language is pushing in the society of change that has been caused in many cases through a technological change .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with two different things .
these are our master-players . 500 million people who are highly good at anything .
and the next decade we have another billion players that are remarkably good at what they are .
so i started thinking about what it is to do these games .
and dr. p. wore it very colorful , and i was just working with kids just like just working .
this is just one example of many , as adults in power positions can improve the imagination of a child .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the nfl player .
we &apos;re so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world are .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new realen-box .
well , when i was a rigging on college , i had my first biology classes .
why not have fast muscle fibers that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
in the good way , when you might think , these decisions are being stuck in us .
but not only do that -- so you can summarize and connect to the universe and other devices out there .
because if we could find that , we would never have before , before , have never been given enough human potential .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , when walt disney was acting .
so we have reminded the memory of the mind and the self itself , and they are really quite different .
it &apos;s about being satisfied or joythe person , when this person thinks about their life .
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both set in the idea of happiness .
but now there &apos;s another question : how hard would these patients tell you that they were suffering ?
and none of these stories is very , very narrow or great -- but one of them is clear ...
it will lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than it is .
there &apos;s nothing in my contact , or it &apos;s out there , no prinper . and you can study anything .
and maybe some of you might have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overflers . &quot;
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve been starting to learn about the happiness of both kinds of self .
is that something that you can play in because now you have a few minutes ?
people are saying that they should think of happiness when they think about policy .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most of the most important problems in the world .
you &apos;re not sitting there and you &apos;re blowing , and there &apos;s always a little bit important to do .
so , it &apos;s probably going to be , or bad , stockacacal , a part of our future .
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can hope to hope with hope .
he was talking about invisible lappings and smoke and how someone wanted to poison in sleep .
but in the ancient greece , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , &quot; people are coming , &quot; people &apos;s mind , &quot; ok ?
and that makes and distorted all of the profile and it creates all these inunses expectations about success .
when we first sequenced the genome at first arrived in the first time , we had a 10,000 base pairs .
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
if we think about biological processes , or any process around it , it becomes a massive challenge .
the electronics industry had a dozen components and look at the diversity that emerged from it .
and i &apos;m going to be dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch her , you know , you &apos;ll see it coming into the next century .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little bits together and correct the errors .
we &apos;ve done it for about a hundred genes to the 500 or so , that are here .
she felt if it came , because it would make earth under her feet to the owe .
but then i remembered , like tom was talking in the free sky , and i was trying .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
and i want to give you a record that i was today , to my part of the jobs here . &quot;
as this happened back then , people knew what this was , they called it at his name .
we made small pieces , we made a mismatch correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
and the west antarctica , which has come across a couple of islands , is particularly strong .
all of these photographs are connected , and something larger than the sum parts of the parts .
and what it does is it makes people go into the shops and ask that question .
if i was to ask you to count the great world accounts , what would you say ?
so , a native is neither sentimental , you &apos;re not allowed to be flag-know-h-tuned .
the nurse who was doing this taery was got brought into a educational camp .
and this actually figures these ideas , these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-up and no more nonsense -- this should not be necessary .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free ourselves out of this misposition .
this is almost complete , so , with almost complete safety -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
you can choose that with many options of one you can choose , people will look very hard to choose .
i &apos;m going to give you another more powerful example of this , a study of investing in volunteers .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , they never never end .
here &apos;s an example . here &apos;s an example of you who are not new yorkers .
so , the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what i need to say myself , even though i &apos;m going crazy is , &quot; don &apos;t worry .
and then you would suddenly see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to have a music to do that .
well , you know , you have to be on all odds , nobody has a discrected candidate .
the dutch government explains it , they &apos;re going to be the first country on the world , which is going to take phosphorus .
we &apos;ve developed a ice cream package , which is a liquid fluid .
this is the first ecological feature , in fact , that &apos;s done to go back in the loop .
you &apos;re thinking of yourself in time , for example , looking at contemporary pictures or reading reading .
i &apos;m also older than the chopin of the prime age , as he wrote the piece .
can i draw that directly or i need to do that , manual and need to do that .
but that &apos;s essential to a tragedy , if you want to be able to build things in outcomes too well .
in the present , we have a modern example that keeps over the daily newspapers and again .
but in europe &apos;s not , we have seven percent , and we have seven percent of the net , physically , the european one .
we just wanted to know , what is it with a regular , sweet electrical chemical battery .
so here we see this again , again , the diesel , single stip , again , all the single length .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not a pitch , child play stuff , we &apos;ve never covered everything , never .
but that &apos;s also what i &apos;m going to do again to the point , when are things going , what is the more intuitive thing ?
they only use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind where they live .
and now i &apos;m going to push the filter with the go-stuff so i can drive the effect of living .
i can reverse the whole sequence , just by putting the pace into one or the other direction .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m involved in with a simple deal of action .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; is &quot; reinventing words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that you can put into any other pattern .
and then more closely effects like tempo and volume that you &apos;re using all the time .
in short , a siensable computer is the size of a kekham .
that &apos;s a whole series of things that you can look next to being a creator .
and i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but can improvise ; they develop dramatically or more .
crucially , it &apos;s extremely important , and it &apos;s much more , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s craig venter now going into the united states that tries to make out of it , so that &apos;s gasoline from algae .
you need to use biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s then a laboratory .
and our approach was to say , well , you don &apos;t have to do that .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- withinjury , 30 percent of that -- chronic back injuries .
we had a team of fellows last year , the code for america .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
and this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs you actually took .
i was under the star sky with the suj singer , atitiar ali .
he allows us to make things much more complexity than the normal methods allow us to produce .
then the night time , like language and so forth , kept less than a million years .
the first step in the story , which i told you , i enjoyed a billion years a piece .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going on in the way that i think this is going on .
that &apos;s because the government is like further ocean , and politics that are the old 12-inch .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
but eventually these realities are actually deheated by suffering , abuse , deconbiation .
and then when you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and quite realistic .
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said . &quot; and it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
in one of the classical asian student , who was the relentless requirements of self-serving .
in a beax , my sister would have my sister and i , then she was doing me and my grandmother .
the next piece of the puzzle is how a boat goes lightly in the early red hole in sea .
now , tosh.0 was on , and started writing lots of blogs about it .
and then again , just a tiny percentage of percentage is ever going to have counted and will look at thousands of times and such the cultural momentst .
i am 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing for you to have never been drinking one drop of alcohol .
the only thing i did is changing the order of that information .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students african-american history . i talk about slavery .
before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
so what can three billion growing up , healthy , educated , productive members of the community community ?
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a movement of a movement of local conmod cannon .
how about the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
for example , this is mr. weiry goluzer from kiew in ukraine .
we &apos;re fit our standards in the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves thinking of what was there .
as you can see , the gogoon of palms and a few manals are left .
and i got a bad sunfire and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get out of there .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the heart of the sick .
you see , on the left , you have a jazz and on the right is boxed , but you know what ?
but finally , i decided to do my god , i must have reasoulate to the court and i have to give you this crazy case .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before will be involved in the world .
and to win , it has to be better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
aluminum was the most valuable of the day on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
think about it that a group of students can influence today today is about billions of people who are able to influence today .
imagine that artificial intelligence of every owner of a mobile phone has to be given to a mobile phone .
i &apos;ve been doing the newspapers &apos; arod-up , and i was looking for the best headlines i could find .
that as humans are not fully designed as long as we &apos;re concerned about human rights and human values .
today we want to talk about how video is being produced , and then , for the reasons , this is important .
we &apos;re so far , with our industrial partners of this device , this new exoskeleton that year .
no , they didn &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
it &apos;s almost physiological to be bad , bad &quot; to be bad blue pants .
about a month after that , i went to a position of my daughter -- the first grader , not a lot of art .
and that sadness is really in a mind , which is that i really wish to be a thing .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to be able to speak negative energy from my life .
and then he said to three words -- the crossword of the most ual words i ever heard .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
during the iceberg , it &apos;s melting as the cheap freshwater freshwater , that many of the life of life is safe for many forms .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with people .
i got another present , which is to see in the future , and come back and live .
and the rotor is this moving part of the centrifuge in a centrifuge , this black object you see .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dummy question i &apos;ve ever heard .
well , just to just end , i want to just point out a lot about the fathers .
well , realizing what i want to do is maintain certain of the time , physically , in our culture .
to understand that these categories are really much insecure than we thought , make me tense .
for example , we push in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in common .
it &apos;s also about race , which is a much more complicated than the time that we applied , which is the terminal termination .
i was the second one in the brand &apos;s time , so i was pretty good opportunities to get there .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .

and this kind of wealth that the virtual power is really needed for the reality of the industrial times , that had needed to be envy , because they had nothing .
and we &apos;re kind of troubled at the medializing campus , the virtual reality in our v.egic laboratory , so we can actually do that all the time .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s said today is really touched me , because many , a lot of beautiful expressions of overbeing that i &apos;ve lived through .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s usually very young people , but the only thing that is going to actually happen to us is this wonderful thing about technology .
and a lot of discussions that i had had in the last six years are similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years , the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years .
basically , every round of the sec on every siticent random randomly letter letter , and you try to make words , you &apos;re going to be tested by a dictionary .
so we set it up to the top time , a sisiting pay money to take an ad action on the way to get the truth over the fact that we &apos;re going to get the truth over .
if your work was brilliant you didn &apos;t look at it all , you know , you knew you had this body genius that helped you .
we will flip it up , and we expect to be able to collect the first data in june or july , and we put our journey to find out what the panels are .
so now it &apos;s the way . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc didn &apos;t have the biggest scientific experiment ever been to the -- 27 miles in diameter .
i was 17 to 10 years old , and i was recording in one of his courses , and i played the last word of the four balposts of chopin , a cliot .
we &apos;re very efficient from the light of humans to make us better enough . our goal is to be a chance of doing that . thank you very much .
so , in any case , it &apos;s an energy sensibility , which is hydrogen , methane , power , power to gas , and it will be .
and i &apos;m saying that , in an epidemic of fear , we &apos;re living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and i will never see again .
but if you have very cheap gas , you can put it in 60 years -- think of a plank -- that you bury in it , without all the most complex biases .
calicali-punding optimism is to make , even a bit to do something , to say , with the belief that we have a committed hope for success .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some more nuanced , you see , you see a couple of nuances of this , which are a little bit of optimism . the eyebroms show surprising .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think or think about the other of your self or think about the living self .
i feel that if we were to work , we &apos;re very often in the case of the case , which means we remind our playmissions in the service of mind .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s a reminder of itself , but time has very little impact on this story .
we have all these superpowers , happy , generous productivity , the ability to connect to the upper social networks , encourage them to make the potential of an end bias and the desire to epend .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that night me is never as hard as it is now , as well as it is , never as hard as it is now , as well as it is , never to .
we went to talk to the music music , and a few days later , i got an email , where , in fact , nathaniel was interested in glidthood .
but the bar grab it straight back , and the bar in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to do that .
and it worked . again , we did something a little bit magical , and the effect of the audience was the same thing . but we &apos;ve been playing a little bit more money .
and we sheased the corner and offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of evolutionary tops , a literally cable carpet that is so far away .
no , i actually felt like i was degufied from this fish because , i swear to god that &apos;s going to cut fish after this conversation for chicken .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas that we love , the tuna , the laostte , the lavox , they &apos;re all broken .
we want to be the world of creators , the inventor , the creator , for the co-creation , because this world we live in , that this interactive world , belongs to us .
not only of darwin &apos;s work is that the ability to survive and thrive , the human mind is destined to transform and to transform on conflict for the human spirit , to transform itself through conflict .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create every livable future , and that we can all create all kinds of games .
what they were sent to have been an anatomical concept , and it was depositing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us were missing .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case the sperm is a y chomooosom , which does it at the x chromosome of the cell cell .
a few weeks later , the fire hit a letter from the house officer , who they were carrying to the brave work on the rescue of their house .
we will have a process that would require maybe 100,000 years , and we can measure it at a thousand years -- and maybe to the next 100 years .
the same technology that produces the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection of themselves , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
it seems that we &apos;re right remote from the other parts of life , but actually the most fundamental part of the building , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
and part of me was wondering , what if the content of a character would be something that would be made in the future -- through fmri ?
i would write it into this : not the most powerful of his kind of kind , and not the intelligent one of its kind , but the intelligent one changes in the best way .
i love a different kind of a bright , aggressive outfit , wearing a different outfit , wearing them , and i &apos;ve been able to read and read and read .
these are two very different units , the endurance self and remembering the other self , and the two are part of the dischanging of the annochness .
there &apos;s a living self living in the present and now , and now , the present is capable of experiencing past the past , but basically the present .
the second case is a representation of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy with your life or happy with your life .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream in and say , &quot; what &apos;s your care ? let &apos;s do the people doing what you want . &quot;
and in a few hours , he ends up and rented a car , and he comes up to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these funnising ted dinner tonight .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he &apos;s going to see us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; -- i &apos;ll do a little solution .
the idea is pretty simple . fourth teams have to have the biggest possible structure of the city , about a meter tape tape , and make a marshmallow .
so if the transportation technology would take conflict , the technology of the microtechnology of technology , then we could get back into a cab and put it in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
i personally speak that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to have a smarter use to make the ideas in your head .
two years later , i had a job in the emergency ward in the middle of toronto , and i measured one 25 year-old man with me ragged by a 25 year-old man .
imagine if you have a blind memory engine , and you &apos;ll be overbitten by a operateur , whose average achievement in terms of lambic human activity .
last month , i had the pleasure of the painse foundation that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million shartiy x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re very hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
of course , the way of randomly elected ones is very small , they have numbers of numbers , so i don &apos;t think they &apos;re doing the ones that are doing this .
so if somebody &apos;s going to offer copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
bg : well we need one of these scaling , electricity , fabricating things that are very cheap , we have 20-year years for inventing and then to take 20 years to take .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed to plan for months to find the different places for the subject of the puzzle .
i meet all kinds of great stuff ; i &apos;m going to give out a way to make a good purpose ; i think i &apos;m quite different ; and it makes a lot of life to do anything completely , and making it shop to make my whole most personal skzer .
unlike the one-century entertainment entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community will become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread , or to make new things .
now , if you calculate this , people would have six times more of a glass of marry , who you had six to test when they had 24 .
and so i look as one of the people , with the most other experimental physicist physicist , who need a good range of logic to bring together the complex ideas together .
well , there &apos;s been shrimp , and eight-dollar brands , these things that come and go , but a twist , lf is a pretty powerful thing .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacder -- you don &apos;t have to have the use of use data about how we &apos;ve seen it at stuxnet .
and i was always proven to get out to me , when this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had a great conversation .
and from my view , the scientific method of looking at things is to see if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the most common achievements of humanity .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine , and reading a real paper role or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple orders .
bg : well , the actual real spending spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not as dramatic .
we can look at it , as we can use co2 , which could be used to fuel , convergence the co2 into fuel to make this process .
and i think we might probably have a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new species based based on this digital design .
it &apos;s a sneak dandanda , if you get full of water with water , it &apos;s enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about 40 to six mature mold .
a project i did with the type of manned the field in switzerland was that we wanted to create something called optical optical or optical fiber .
i talked to it , don &apos;t stop listening , you do , you , you and you , you and i know , when this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that one day he was riding on a freeway in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
a process that &apos;s going to ever act -- like everyone who &apos;s ever tried to do something -- not always in other words , actually , everybody here -- not always causal .
now , of course , in a way that accidents are repeated , again , the debate around the value of science and engineering to such a boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
so , of course , that &apos;s like being ringing in the context of my talk , we don &apos;t move existing , virtual worlds , all of the way we can model the holocene .
so we have now from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourselves , why are all the designers of themselves begin with so natural , archaaay of communication , interaction and so forth .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and conformated all the characteristics on the new software that we put into the cell .
it &apos;s got exananated in the cell and realized the other chromosome as the foreign dididididim and so we had just a single chromosome with a new chromosome .
every step we have in excess with the surplus produces these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence , because we tried to create a very robust process of doing what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
the reason is , the first time it was better was when all the bad was , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a good surprise .
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of traping the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
we can watch our children playing , and we have our phone phone on a hip , and we have a hip phone on the top of other hip , and we may probably have our laptop on the same way .
it &apos;s not that easy now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you get enough energy in it , you get too far there .
the official dogma works like this , if our goal is maximize the increation of our citizens , it &apos;s mostly about the attacks of the individual .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , designed by coal , because we don &apos;t know , or gaberup binets , because it can &apos;t be done .
and i got to milk &apos; 80s &apos; 80s in berlin because i wanted to make my renewable energy and that &apos;s not in karllasca .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure i have to be a director also has to lead a leader , a guide like ship capc-am , or something like that .
you go up into these capsule , then you just floating in this dark , smothful environment , where no hope is , if you can &apos;t bring it back .
i bumped my father , until finally , a hiol school at buffalo , new york , had been missing on the other side of the border where we lived .
and since it wasn &apos;t the video games , or these over-saturation with computer-generated films , all the imaging language in the media landscape had to create the images in my head .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because then in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
we should call them what she is , a chicago in a crederalls , an industry that gives rise to capital capital that allows you to do that .
it &apos;s very different from saying we have a three-and-a-half high truck truck under a three-foot bridge , which is something that &apos;s got to be put in a three-foot bridge .
and our european species and atoms systems are basically just dirty rostenes of great power plants , where the wave is around europe .
and as you knew in the village , then , who &apos;s going to do what was happening to what and when , what , this is what happened today , this expansion of our self is going through the global level .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of prefall is wrong , it would be the opposite of the opposite , of course .
and these corns know that in the heart of the book , he knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that he can &apos;t say that .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral position , it &apos;s a mistake because , let &apos;s try to replace it through replacing even more even even a even even even incontinuating even .
i can now change the comfort that bach has loved on the modern wing sound of what a baroaroy can &apos;t do .
these are the first shoes that you can put to the catty light on the footlight song , and you can move your rubber in biological cycles , right ?
all right , so , very exciting , it doesn &apos;t actually process in this , but here &apos;s the only thing that is in this roroy mass right now too .
so if you take the system as i was taught it , and all the flabs of health scientists were locked out , there &apos;s no more left .
some time ago , it was like , if you wanted to win a formula , your budget and then her money would take money on a good driver and a good car .
play is a shape-activated , and it can adopt many forms of some kind of quiet , mathematical , curious -- maybe to explore the really hard again .
and my friends , the great , giant , sandmovies , say that the reason their movies are so successful about giving the brand cake they have .
and if you &apos;ve already met that the drtopper of the stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the use of user data is a science for itself .
so , this really , in a sense , really got my interest , and we started working on it almost around , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
and there &apos;s probably quite the toughest of the street art scene in there , brosy , shepard , discovering , caws , caws -- all these guys will be there .
one , we have the insurance insurance , and actually for wary , we got a device that can communicate with it -- a stephen hawking machine .
in that we gave him a little push , we could make it vibrate at the same time , and not vibrating them -- something that allowed us in the quantum mechanics .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , many of you have seen that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world world .
he came up with the director of congress , and he said , &quot; professor romer , i &apos;m going to thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
and so far the isolation is , if we are as a species , it becomes insulating and the changes of the environment , it &apos;s going to produce insulation and the changes of the environment that we can make evolution in natural ways .
and by the way , we go and divide and blend and blend so much that it &apos;s no longer possible to find that isolation is necessary for evolution to find the evolution of evolution .
so they invented , according to hereotus , the box game and the turclabs to a national strategy , and one day you &apos;d be playing . next day you &apos;d play .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian , geodenotus are familiar , you might know this story , the story about how and why games had been invented .
but also , because it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using all this time on playing all this time , actually , what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects i received is , i get the most feedback , or where i had the biggest achievement , those who are interacting with things directly with interacting with .
so the fact is , the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem so well , as the blue pill doesn &apos;t seem like the needle .
take two programs , and they make kids through the exchange of their subroutines , and the kids &apos; characteristics the characteristic of subroutines from the two programs .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and then these cells started to communicate and share information so that communities from cells started to be developed .
and i went back through the same torden-level of shame and self-doubt , and it was forced to get away and went to work until it again and again .
i may have so successful and so capable of taking responsibility to take responsibility that i was so privileged and so i would have been able to do my patient &apos;s position without getting it in contact with it .
how about the oppressed , where about it , can be a voice to look at yourself and make change , for the very first time ?
if i think that affluence , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; i &apos;m about to create a life full of possibilities .
in the next book we &apos;re trying to use a conversation with the internet of the ipads and augmented an augmented reality animation that looks at a plant from the house in a plant from the house .
if we don &apos;t want to do that if we do that , we have been guilty about something like that , i think , to be far , very colonialism .
so one organism could learn , for example , to eat a specific frutainment , because they didn &apos;t kiss bad and he made sick , the last time he ate them .
and it turns out that when you manage that something feels a little bit , it feels a very good tool to save people to save it .
there &apos;d never be the history of technology , this kind of recurtive growth of growth , by which all the time , all the time , are growing exponentially for a few years .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like this , like , others , what we often find in the field , is a kind of right on a log graph .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country getting up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
and it will allow people to measure their blood blood blood , put it on their doctor and give him a little over 100 dollars for a little over 100 dollars .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually direct , but i always want to let this look like you could , in a photograph , like you could , in a picture .
if i told you that somebody has been their life on a scale of a 10 percent scale , it has a lot of insecurity about how happy it is to do with his living self .
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because it &apos;s the sky that people depend upon which people depend in the forest .
and if you want to make an informed citizen , you want to make sense of all the value and the technology , then you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
because it makes the same sense of what i &apos;ve heard about , if it was all about that , which i &apos;m about to explain , if it &apos;s all crazy , fake little enforced city of the creative process .
no , it looks much better if we show that we are in charge of fixing the risks , the other one first when you put fire on top of the way .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i can have the experiences , the piece that i &apos;ve done so long in advance of how new it works .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economies , but if it comes to the environment , the highest is not there , right ?
so , if we look at that we can transfer existing choices from one to something else , the metaphor , then i can do it as a metaphor .
of course , the designers are not just engaging with the issue and then using neural stimulation or cognitive data , but primarily , by course , the subject of human-expressed connection .
it can &apos;t be like this , but it can &apos;t be transformed for its actions and claims of responsibility , and so it is disutilized .
we start in the process of putting the leadership in two . we &apos;ll start putting them into a series , and then add them to a little bit more voice .
there was just the case that it had self-confidence service and one of them sitting in a cruise mountain in a little while where you were supposed to be evil .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine sense of being , which is coming from a distant , unknown source to people -- from untapped , unknown reasons .
everything you have to do is to take the bitter nutritional pay from really great mouths , just the young century , who died with their own hand .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth of a second , in the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s to be 600 million times within a second .
and even if you were off all of your child , every minute we &apos;ll be in our child at the mutilated , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , again , and again , whether we should be working or not to work .
it &apos;s a third set of purpose that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences and do that as if the opposite of the first sentence has proven , and suggests that it &apos;s already proven to the opposite of the first sentence .
the whx americans don &apos;t stop to sioux when they were batting and the arrow when the americans stopped to be the one by being the horse and horse drivers .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallow oceans , is as rich as the rich life is , as we can &apos;t possibly imagine .
now , if we go on and go through age , we see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents should actually make the leading cause of cause people .
this is the greatest time it ever has on this planet , no matter how scale you can do it : health , affluence , mobility , opportunities , change disease .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies now , and we need hundreds of those , as well as their approaches , that are working for their pilots , for example , to provide it .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the waste that &apos;s already already already , which is in these refrigerators or dry or dry people in these reactors . that &apos;s our seed fuel .
the other note is , if we use the zero-footprint technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way that we &apos;re going to get them to the rest .
but in the middle of &apos; 90s , we found that we found that we were in the center of food and proval-making -- which was actually what we had for the company in the city .
about 12 years ago , a story came out , a horrible history that the autism epidemic , the masvles , and manle-making vaccine in action .
now , having elected , i know , that the wikipedia peegis is to be deliberating , most people from the year .
and also , our system has been an agreement , because we &apos;re going to do that in a minute seven percent of the diesel things that we don &apos;t get through .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m taking it , and you should do it , because these love of love , like romantic , is also naked .
well , i was calling a number of people in the company , no one could give me a decent answer , until finally , i was finishing up with the senior biologist .
and i will always make nathaniel play everywhere , whether in the world disney hall or skid row , because he reminds me why i got a musician .
and this is kind of a little of our vision of a kind of spounatuative energy , and i &apos;m sylenst for cradle to be said that they &apos;re saying solar energy .
so , you know , there &apos;s also a change that &apos;s going there , and it &apos;s only from that assault stance to the idea of seeing 100 percent renewable is yes .
and she &apos;s working in medical culture , recognizing that people fill the system with life and when that is , people also do mistakes at time .
but tomorrow , it can be able to challenge us to the future challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can then change from the digital world to the physical .
and finally , saturday : we have a unique , unique style of personal style , is a great way of telling the world to tell you about something without having to say .
i mean , it can sound funny to think that one thing is at the same time , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
so , dedegested and decosted , we made the depel code and found out that in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
the drockers are actively going around the gray box , when a particular configuration was discovered , and even if this particular program , it &apos;s trying to infect it on that goal .
now , if we &apos;re going to turn on the systems that control the raw and the valves control , then we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
it &apos;s like that ties , their connections with all the things you see around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the most profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
so one day i decided to visit the request of the leader , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that you can actually do all of these possibilities ? &quot;
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m also going to leave you some of the lessons that i &apos;m , if you &apos;ve learned it or not , from this adventure , nothing new to wear .
they were the notion that people who had people who had this political power , they should have these political power , because of the blood of the grandfather to son and so on .
one of the areas that we &apos;ll take in the field of this culture , today , in the united states today , is the struggle , and the end of life .
and it was only when he was 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was retired inside the doctors that the doctors found out that he was in the heart of their own .
but i bet that it &apos;s playing with the floor of a very valuable lesson , which is not just going to stop the thing you just leave , and you &apos;re still going to stay there .
and most of all , i &apos;m going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom , we will be able to make sure we make a difference to make these decisions make sense ?
there are lots of buildings like that , especially in a place where they would like to go to america , especially in a place where they would live there .
so they either survive , or they went underground , and they were going to go underground , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the community &apos;s individuals were more frequently more and by evolution .
and because the government finally takes their power from us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re going to say we &apos;re the people , &quot; -- how we think about this change will affect the way that this change is going .
and so , that &apos;s what i sent home to you , misspevely , i was a little voice in myself , trying to say , &quot; the goldman sachs , don &apos;t do that . &quot;
well , with all our digital devices that make us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all those negative news is to make it a miracle of mist .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve been collecting about the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
and when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this one of my mouth to the forest and i went to the forest .
and second , as a species species , we have really reconforced our environment to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
so , the people who decided to get involved in trying to get the more possibilities to give you the more , the more people are being pushed up and to choose .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play together certain kind of play , to control their health .
and not with the help of your husband , she would not pay her with a sense of doing it in trial and she was a larger deal than she won .
but the nine-largest supermarket that &apos;s now on top of the world today is aldi , and they &apos;re only giving them 1,400 extra products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in different ways and different types of research -- which they just apply to in their business .
but it takes time until you hit puberty , and then they grow , but they don &apos;t even get their course , until somebody comes from being there , that there &apos;s something different about it .
this plant includes some very strong tral tames that &apos;s in serotonin , dimethyltral tamel , and manipulation of the brain , in a very similar way .
that &apos;s how the future may look for changes in changes , today , today , evolutionary flu is accelerating , today , evolutionary flu , and potentially eukaryonte .
we have fuels from the two two-foot and third generation that will have a much higher sugar asset , like cruckor or different kinds of buol .
the second thing is that since this archatic models , we have been able to talk very , very precisely , as we now use a coding language .

if i know something three seconds , i get out of the present to the past , then i can also go out of the present , i can also train on the street to the back of it .
but i have to understand , in the core , understanding when gets information to information , when is going to be made of information , and from information , so i know how to do things very intuitively or , of course , i can make it possible .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were used because this information has had to learn from the individuals that died because these information systems didn &apos;t have been existed yet .
so , i &apos;ve actually taken you off a little bit of thousands of grandchildren that they don &apos;t see patterns anymore , but i &apos;ve been indusive in a short time of time , and then i &apos;m disconditioned by that dog in a short way .
we see this when i rewire things , then i can blend them out like a on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make them so kind of using things like i &apos;m showing .
and i realized that at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a fellow , new shot , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you must be grateful to , perhaps a gift of the camp .
i said , in some pretty horrible situations , i &apos;ve been taking myself in some pretty horrible situations , but nothing couldn &apos;t be prepared to me , to me , to go to something so hard , so dangerous as to walk with these guys in a room .

he redescencated the dog and he grabbed a dishes , took a slebling , fouching a dog of the dog and the displned handings with the backcalibs on the belt .
and then again , again , it goes back to the face , because the back doesn &apos;t actually look at the front , and he says , &quot; now , look still , i &apos;m sure that what you see is that this is what you see .
and i guess you can see that there are many different types of cameras : everything is involved in the hand-right agnostic , a pretty large number of you , all of which are put together in this environment .
so , before the background , i just went to see what is it , which is , what is most of us , what is , of course , what does the difference look like , what is it , but instinctively , what does the difference ?

and it was just been used to be used to software , but there &apos;s also a whole training of training , there &apos;s also a whole kind of training field that can make electronics all the way .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been showing it for a few years now with the biopressure , and i &apos;ve been working on this , because i wanted to just understand and do it , and it was mainly very accurate about what i &apos;ve learned in my study .
do you fear you &apos;re going to go on your life for your life and never come up there and be kind of going to be your mouth , you know , and you &apos;re going to die of your mouth , you filled up the little bit of the peanuts ?
here &apos;s a dread shot from the molecule that we made by using these processes -- actually , we used it to be used with the right design of the artifacts , we have it all in place .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maaese and hopaese and hopctions , you can use your iphone and you can use your microphone cell to find the next tracker , saving life .
what we learn from cultural backgrounds , is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- tend to give that complex social relationships and the care -- tend to give them a lot of attention .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s dwarcgrown or spoamese twins , it &apos;s very sexually -- of surgeons often to the norm , not because it &apos;s for their physical health for their advantage .
and finally , i think that although you &apos;re so dramatic and inspiring , so beautiful and inspiring , and so we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not the things we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and mind .
so the question i ask you here is : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
it &apos;s worth me all the year in the clean space , because , you check this , the scale of a single atom and a single metal is just as same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .

you know , the genocide , the gut extinction of people is generally convicted , but the consumer imregard the lifestyle of the human , not just not being convicted , but generally , and more knowledgeable than the one of an economic strategy .
and the question to me , the question : what are we going to do , because our science of these things are going to make these advances in the context of the universe that we have to say that democracy is based on anatomy , falls down ?
so this is a kind of effect . the other effect is that even if we can actually overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice than when we had the opportunity to choose that we have a chance of delivering between a total of options .
you have a little bit earlier of time with a privilege of time with a privilege of &quot; enough &quot; the note &quot; the note &quot; -- they told them they were being rusty , and after that three months , they really wrote in .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself today how much his vision of mine and powerful young girls shaped my self-picture , and i imagined that i could see myself one of nature in a strong , powerful and atarian human .
i always write my vol in the writing , but i was with the process of doing it , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never taken the texd , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; .
so if you have this idea you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , you &apos;ll be buried by the larger pile that put them back , you can also feel the little bit that they have to be a free will like it .
i &apos;m the creator of my house , and i &apos;m also , of course , the theme of curiosity and how it changes how the curiosity is , and how we need to stop thinking about curiosity and need to reresaw and rerere-re-re-sare-re-recourage and have to go back and forth .
but that &apos;s like my prototype , but it &apos;s kind of crashed my prototype , and it &apos;s stuck down like this , and it &apos;s stuck on a branch , and it was a pressure that was actually going too high , and it was broken up , and it was the pressure that was broken .
the last example i have today is to show it to me , is a music sequencing for live performances , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and that we &apos;re giving as a sound as a sound , as a seductor , heartand sks .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a capital boy is going to be used in this area of fish , not being used , or from fishing professors , not working , because it &apos;s not known &quot; philosophical &quot; .
there &apos;s wiolties and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real , and every person is concerned differently , but the question is not whether we can get wrong or not , but the question is not whether we can get out of a handle or not , but we can get it right .
heinrich , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you he &apos;s a cake , he &apos;s able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be manled , what &apos;s not going to have to worry about .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when i was just starting to build the primary image from my family zone and form how to form my self-image from my family zone and the rest of the world around me .
if i have this uplong marriage , i would be born to a world that somebody like me to perceive , who can live in a virtually unfamiliar way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated and adventure and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so maybe this is a really compelling shift to this , ever proven that there was a different truth , which is that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human being has a very special thing , and that the human capacity , to adapt to the environment , is the biggest one .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid we should not allow the science of a dead end , and it &apos;s keeping millions of people from chaos .
and because without the pedal legs , my feet would pick up for them , and then i just packed a few toes on this and a pair of toes on the other foot , this gang had to get the bad news .
because no matter whether it &apos;s the health minister who is , say , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not have the census of my expert &apos; record , &quot; or some cancer hazard beerie that wants to treat his patients with caff-harvesting .
but when i was engaged with him , and asked him why he did this procedure -- they were highly risd-on surgeries -- he was the answer that in his country , these children , these children would be treated very well , and so he had to do it .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is like in this case , you know , this day , this day , when you hit the ceiling down , you get pictures of people who were there and saying , &quot; you &apos;ve broken the building . &quot;
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of attack is actually the goal of attack , it &apos;s slow and it &apos;s going to be more accurate -- obviously , to allow waroring to get behind the course .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us are in our best version , or now , we &apos;re willing to do tenacious problem , trying to try and do a very tenacious problem as long as i need .

so that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about earth that we say , there &apos;s no organic division , no chemical , no natural trs , and as they all all , they allow us to go back .
we look in this web , and the 50 of the 50 hertz , and if it gets to the sixty-40 , nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start to make some guns , then a little merig pops up , then we come back up .
and i think that the interactive media set of aaaic , cognitive models , is to address the paradigm that we biological memory are very , very long , and that we can also retool the world through the interactive media .
and i just think one of these little devices is high because things are always more intuitive , always , over-friendly , over-friendly , over-friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s really for humans , which is ususpolisible , or intuitive .
and if i step out further in this natural user interface , where i can get a voice from voice , with language , by touch , or even if you have to control things , i &apos;m even faster and even more backward .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember it , when i first told me that over 20 years ago , when i first told that i was a teenager , i was faced with the same kind of anxiety response response .
and i got it all about six and six of them , and then we have friends of the company on a country on the hot back of the world , and then then became the spin-off of the company on the earth .

and as a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing by hearing from musical concerts from the violin of a concert , and then asked me to play it to the end , darssus , tjajaus .
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on top of one another , so instead of going from one to another , from a number of things to the other , and can see patterns which otherwise were hidden in otherwise ?
now buying a glass of marry is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also very good for our waist-- but it turns out that the decision is that we have a very conforment decisions of it .
now i have to confess , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , your sex death , your sex death -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my gnp question .

it &apos;s in the -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made out of normal letters , which we &apos;re using to use -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so what happens in &quot; the the &quot; &apos; itkeeper ever place , from the top to the bottom , is completely identical to the end , is actually identical to the end , which is the brand one , the brand one .
we took a perandan camera , they set them apart , they set them up on a set light light , and now we have a device that &apos;s available -- you can build it , we hire the code for free .
so we started with some volunteers who were coming to see a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to use things that they &apos;d all culelx to the things they were throwing away to throw away on . things that you would see as much of it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m the secretary of junior , and every kid in italy grow up with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is , this is what happened in the formula for the last few decades .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these cases -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , who had some preamese twins who had come to separate them , in part , to make a name .
now , what &apos;s fascinating is that the tatasters that are in the litens have been in the lio-berbitors , mao dances , of exactly the kind of things that are necessary to minimize the coryptamtamine . so ask yourself .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was making a very fundamental thing : most of the existence of life in a solitary culture , and it &apos;s delivered on both the genetic information of the cell , and then on both the genetic information of the cell , it &apos;s gone further into both toirs .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food if they retire , if they &apos;re going to retire , it means that they &apos;re going to be missing huge money , it means that you &apos;re missing huge investment delivering employers .
he said to me , &quot; i have to say to your parents you never would walk , never as moving as other kids would be , and you could never run a more independent life , and have never been a more independent life ever since ever ever since ever ever . &quot;
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around the world , if we &apos;re going to take the barriers to the next century , the face of those who are facing all the wiwest-ups on a epic demographic .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , in americans , and that &apos;s a very large cluster of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year .
now , when i turn my hand from you so you can see it from the back , it &apos;s going to move this slide here , my turfingers , just from the place where it was so slished .
so there &apos;s big scale challenges here , there are challenges in transmission , if we say that the energy source is from the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology ; you need to deal with the risk that the energy of the world is coming from .
it has three big problems that have the cost of the cost , especially in high-level countries , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human intelligence , that the fuel isn &apos;t used for weapons .
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems if we change the waterspots , inside the way , that they can just back to cell cellue , and then you can plant a baby in israel or in tunisia 100 or in tunisia .
and they &apos;re getting healthier by the use of the cocosters , and you &apos;ll be trained by the khan academy , and by using the opportunity to use 3d and &quot; the &quot; &quot; cable cable &quot; and so much more productive than they &apos;ve ever been before .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of remembering , and you can think of yourself as one that &apos;s sort of like the living self , which doesn &apos;t need to be made up of the living self .
so i wrote on an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; franken-eating oil , &quot; why they thought that molecules were going to be , in a certain way , to a kind of a random kind of area of nature .
tan le , anonymous , habits of skscus , was now brodden , refugee and social activist who was invited to attend to places you &apos;d never heard of , and in housing , whose existence she never heard of .
what we did was we did this very simple thing , in the increase of a 20 percent increase , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or reduce a rise in the number of people they were ready to pay for the savings accounts .
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator alone , i &apos;m going to add all kinds of weird things , but then you get to other people , and i &apos;m not going to get to make these things because i want not to make it , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to tear away .
i was asking myself to place and place above his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my suggestion is this : tony is going to talk , tony is speaking , we &apos;ll get him a device and we &apos;ll figure out how to make his art .
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be in the right position of people because i must admit that i have to say that i know that i know that i know a series of malretrierever earning a few people that i know .
if you can make someone into a person , your own internal forces -- the human mind is so sensitive -- when you do it , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re so passionate about this person , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the enjoyable modern artist who was trying to dominate these runaway creative impulses that lived in his late , and with them .
and then there are things that are totally in the everyday part of what most people are not aware of , for example , in downtown middle enzymes that allow us to wash up 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetic operusses .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of the fortune &apos;s fortune , and there &apos;s something on this task , which is the deep impressions of the fortune of the 50-year company , and i want to share a few of them with you today .
and then the next one , which is already going on in a very brain brain model , or mental models like this , has worked , you know , that you have a picture of something that is the metaphor , the metaphor of the desktop to harness the computer .
and you can see that you have a look at our seven senses , most people think about only five , and it &apos;s probably seven of them , and it &apos;s actually seven of them , and it &apos;s also about the self , and it &apos;s also our own version .
this was a big hit , because of course , the living language started to manifest the form of writing , which is what &apos; is in &apos; and alive , i start putting it in stone and i &apos;m stuck with that in stone and i do it .
i graduated in and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , brought it to crally , and that &apos;s the degree work work , and i &apos;m going to mess from michael burit-weaving and jan-moritz .
and yes , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heterosexuals , so that &apos;s the equivalent of people who do it alone , up to large , big organizations that are even more empowered in the past developed situation .
and they &apos;re also called the general doctor , so that it can see where my prejuangsity are , not only the moment i need to do &quot; cardiological , or whatever , but also , with a view of the past .
now , what this thing does is it &apos;s beginning to capture the existing values of sensors -- so , for example , data sensors and vibration -- and it &apos;s legitipairing code to deal with the data , running with the wrong data , running .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and memorils , just to discover and look , immediately , characterizing , express by imvisibility and access to information , to the last line , which is the last line .
and dr. kean did not continue to say , &quot; i learned that when they &apos;re not always a different one , and even if you get a little bit of help , even if you get kids out of their own , then kids can achieve much . &quot;
what if they could change the sperm and the cell cells or the fresh flush to make a better chance of giving a life life for a healthier life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the drmophila risk of cancer ?
i think that they were so taking and strong , so radical , in what they did , i &apos;m going to see all the time in the guey , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
and if i came back to a step , and look at everything , i can turn my trajectory back to my search past , maybe after my search past , i have been looking for the road past , right here to live labs .
to the turn of plant crops , chocolate checks to monopoly , chemicals to the earth , chicken on the earth , chicken on the earth , chicken on the earth , and all the agricultural industries were asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge culsty of mayante , mustard , oil and marry , but we certainly can &apos;t pick the comparison and go out and actually choose something that &apos;s fantastic providing .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to work a year of time and work in a environment that is pretty much about everything they really hate , we &apos;ve put them in the government .
i think there are theories that actually started to understand how everything started from rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a story about what is , at that time , little oil droplet around of chemicals .
this curiosity also turned out to be , when i wasn &apos;t in school , i wandered and i went , &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and snakes and snakes and frogs and ponds , all of them , and looked at the microscope .
you can think of this cultural life system as a race sphere , because ethnic majority sphere can be considered the whole amount of minds and dreams , giving up some old ideas from the human imagination as well defined .
and this is quite astonishing because you actually think that this super-technology you &apos;ve been flying out is that you &apos;re actually going to bring that up into the future , but in fact , the future is right in us , in our archatic roots .
and those sound and rhythm have the geology , which represented the topography of a region , and that has also enabled you to reinterferd and reinterd and put it on the left , right up to the right , to the right , to the extent of even the degree of even , to the right , and then back in the middle of the incident .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species have to find these two morphons on the other plants that , if they combine that , a kind of chemical version , that the whole larger than the sum is in size ?
so she &apos;s running to the house , and she &apos;s looking for paper , and she picks up a pencil , right now , when she goes through , and then she grabs a pencil right now than it goes through , and then she got there -- she was going to grab it .
so if i do that , the proyor at the crime , go to it , collect some kind of yelash , and then they go to this process , and then they can say , well , this is a little bit of the body , and then you can say , well , this hair belongs to this man , like this .
a continent will always slip , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course there was a and voodoo faith that &apos;s very profound in the post-time highlands of the species of the species .
and later the day later , i went around this site with miguel around , and i asked him , i said , &quot; you know , for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you do succeed ? &quot;
and then , when i &apos;m going to add a prime and a half european and not just another one , which is , you know , the circle , the circle , and , but we see an entity , we don &apos;t see more three pieces , a circle , a circle , a cycle , a cycle , a circle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a circle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a cycle , a
imagination is more separate because of her tiet , and i want to end up with this sentence , a more convenient note , also designers have to think differently , thinking to be able to get in new solutions , and in that sense , i &apos;m really sure you &apos;re going to get your attention , and please .
and by playing music and talking about music , this was a little confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a comic style , educated , excellent , dododo-trained musicians .
about an hour after that , after she got home , she would open up and she would , and she would , and she would , and she would , they launched 911 . the rescue , they brought back to the emergency room with a minimum of 50 , which is a dangerous shock .
now , what you might do with the patient a way , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually put the gut appearance of the patient &apos;s up there without just drawing the hose in it without just drawing it into it .
if you just invested to me for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , halbiely energy gas gas , is going to be redefined by co2 that &apos;s going to be reborn .
what i do , what the designers of thinking do , do that , is we think of a kind of abstract level , we think of the machine , and the machine makes something far beyond it that has far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever make it .
and again , the idea is , again we &apos;re going to engage the people with something to do and change the environment -- almost something as we call it , cloudmotion , like this , but by a cloud .
we worked with roberto bolki , one of the best words of our time -- the saudi tole at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in milan -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse for the flywater .
and the reason the ocean is available is bacteria , the therophil are not able to have the hot cold , and if the fish were there , it would be a vacuum vessel for themselves , but they have managed to make a habitable environment there .
we think postmics -- we think that the u.s. &apos;s not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million people every month .
she ran like the devil while she was paralyzed by this poem , which is the only thing she was running enough to do , and it was not about that she had to get fast enough to catch a sheet of paper and a pen so that it would catch it through her , and by being able to capture , and on the sheet .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that measures their health of their predatory being , but a farm that &apos;s literally using a water plant plant , and not just for those fish , but also for you and i.
so all of this discussion , how is it going forward , and moving in the moment , energy shifting , like this is going to be , on the island , we have to reduce five percent reduction , so we have to stay the wind and the sun .
that you have to understand as a translator , as a translator , through the word to a different language , but the deeper senses of words and worgy have to understand , so it makes a sense of good , it knows everybody who has existed with foreign languages .
so if you look at google , for example , then this concept of the virtual world can combine the real world with the real world , which is our character indefinition to virtual realization , which is our character indefinition to become virtual exploration , to feel again .
the older black man stood up . he saw the puputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to come to tell this young man , don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i think maybe what i think is more , is that we don &apos;t have to cross the natural placty , but that we &apos;re being engaged for embracing them , to put it on , and even to use it to you .
not by the latest concern and tractor innovation , but by bleeding land , not through pumps , but by fresh water , not through the ocean , not by the air boats and nets , but by the fish in the ocean .
i &apos;ve told you about four technologies that make sense of choice , which is narrow -- are -- are you real ; put it on , put it out -- put it real , put -- we can do more more categories , less opportunities ; to adapt to complexity .
pppps are things that are consistent , just like the jump jump , timings , adventure , adventure , guian and luian , adventurous and char-fl-hok .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not so far between male and female , or by male and intermature and both unclear and both unclear , touch socially , touch that line of , of course , are not .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place , people in evolution , and particularly how we think about the place , i would say it &apos;s a series of ways .
and in that song , we will be able to discover the possibility that we are : people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of all humans and gardens , and there are great moments of optimism .
and maybe a little peek on what might happen in a few decades if you have wi-fi body to explore something or to do things to do , to do things , to do things , in all kinds of post-cursible things that i imagined as a science fiction .
so finally , a consequence of buying a bad token on a maundo surface , when it &apos;s just a way to buy it , and ask yourself why who is responsible , the world is responsible , and the world is responsible , what would you have done ?
and you have wind and sun and the load and then recorded , a very fascinating thing that you could go across the conventional system , which is to get a middle layer of nuclear to the conventional system that takes you to be a middle column from about 50 cents a kilohour hour .
and before the background , i got myself in the field of natural music design , so the next generation of man computer in the field of human computer is working on how our tools or the computer can be turned on with the computer sukhenal to the digital wizcene .
the first project we &apos;ve done as a international group is when we were to sort of become aware of ourselves , or audik , now we now have the kind of real scene , and we &apos;re familiar , and we &apos;re familiar with the people who always are awake and so forth .
so this is one more artistic alignment , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers with scientists who are dealing with these technologies and are just about asking questions , and that is creative , because there are museum exhibitions and yes , that there are museum exhibitions and yes , all kinds of things .
at this point , the patient &apos;s getting into the game , and they can &apos;t just take control of control , captain on their own ship , but also help us help in the face of the challenge , and also help us help the cost of health care , twice as demand , and so on .
and if you make that a few minutes for it , you have to say that the living self is a bad one , and you have a payoff that you have a much better time about your experience , because you have given a better story about his experience .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo attacking placebo , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , which is a magician that &apos;s interested in a magician , because , you think , it &apos;s like me , as i do , as i think it &apos;s a delusion that &apos;s going to be just enough to remember .
and the next weeks i was going to resist , and i learned the very first time i had the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , i couldn &apos;t be the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
how many times do we have to get a political leader -- and sometimes we have used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we expect the government to reflect on our values and then have changed not much ?
so what you get was , you see , your name here : my tedtalk , you know , you know , that &apos;s going to be the topic , and that you &apos;ll have to be able to fly on the content , especially if i gave their company to their participation .
in fact , i &apos;ve been facing the most of my career in a deep situation , and all of this is just in trying to study social guards that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way that makes them fun and more interesting , and hopefully , in a way of making a sense of what they do in the audience .
and he was watching me one day , and he was able to do this sort of thing -- and he was just tititified -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;ll be like one of these headurses , and he said to me , &quot; wow , you &apos;re like one of these wheels .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago , which was the compelling birthday i had ever had , and i think quite often in proportion to how often i think i think i &apos;d do other trips in the relationship .
the neolithmon-revolution , which brought us in agriculture , and we have underallooped us at the sense of the cult of the seed cores , the poetry of the shake and the hierarchy , specialization and gained and gained -- found only 10,000 years ago .
with total transparency , which is the new thinking of what the new thinking is , you don &apos;t know that in the lasara , you don &apos;t know that in the lasagbar , you don &apos;t know that in the lasagbar meat , i want to do it just .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s being smart , if you will , but now there &apos;s an discourse in a geoengineering way of doing it , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering ways to do that , if things are coming faster or going to take this innovation longer than we expect .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never afford to see whether it would work , but since there &apos;s been modern supercomputers , you can actually simulate it and see that , yes , with the right material of materials , it looks like it works .
they combined the up-generated co2 , which is going to increase at temperature elevates , and it &apos;s going to have to follow some very negative consequences , effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the variant that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t be able to adapt to the change , and then all the systems back together .
you do it for the job of being the challenge -- and the ocean is challenging territory that you can do , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people is bringing a team to a team .
i took them with them and i gave them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in this extreme world , and i made them go around the sources so they could take themselves around , samples and instruments and so on .
here you have this anctor between the unconscious and the conscious person , which immediately jumps back , without having to do something about it , and the things that you can tell you about it , and the things that you can tell you is very different , and you can sound with it .
but if you can buy a new color printer today , from the leading laser manual , and print a site , then this page is bright yellow spots on each side , in a pattern that has flexible yellow spots on each side , in a pattern that has flexible to reveal its printer .
these may be a moderates and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all of these five , and we can &apos;t cut any of them because they all have significant problems .
some of the following expeditions i &apos;ve seen in thermalvents , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen anyone before , and i sometimes had some things that have never seen before , and the science at the time when we saw them , no words existed .
i &apos;m going to just describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with gur hubert , and i did the following , which we did , where we were putting the choices to savings plans for almost one million americans in the entire united states .
in honduras , the leaders of government in honduras are dependent on the help of partnership countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they would be doing in the order of the law and implementation that everybody can make trust that the charter is going to really be resolved .
so the tedtalk is in a very simple form that a charter city is a place where the first place that the law is , the beginning of the world , defined the way that the law determines that they have , and the opportunity to decide whether to live either under those rules or not .
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of an 19 year-old man who was born as boy as boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , living as a man , he had just found himself to be sticks and had a uterus .
in our desire , the people who are being guiding us , and the cool truth about their medical rabbit or even a projection for life that you want to know , we need to make a look for the quality of life that you want to be disabled .
and then there &apos;s a memory reminder , and remember , remembering itself is that it &apos;s getting tattoos and is going to end up the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that is the doctor accepting the question , &quot; how have you felt ? &quot;
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are just three fingers here , because the mind and the way it process information is not one of them , one , two , three , it &apos;s as a group .
and i know that some of you are saying , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; if we all talk to one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s get this language of gratification . let &apos;s go , &quot; let &apos;s get this language of gratification .
we monitored the genetic analysis to eight generations , and we found two instances of a natural death , and when we asked people to handle something about his age , they gave them that one of the people had become so old that he died , because of his age , and we were killing him , and even the spear .
he spoke in a very hot and social clay note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton saying , and the dodgers never creating the word world , and all of this is because of the passage of an extra passage of beethoven &apos;s ninth , the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth rdel .
because we &apos;re having this self-deception , this feeling of being great by the top creatures , not one of the other creatures like this sort of thing , as uncharted as a organism , as well as the organism that exists , and otherwise the things that are so undesigned for us .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no space for myly creatures that are going to take orders from the divine .
an inweird event , i was writing a book recently -- a biography called the dining of the dining -- a biography called the dining of the dining -- which decided to be different from all my previous books for some reason in the world and a large event event .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our own , trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all can eliminate all of these genes that we can eliminate one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans in one type , and they bought it , and they &apos;ve been comfortable , they were incredibly non-comfortable , and when they &apos;ve been paying them for them , and they &apos;ve been very much enough having washed enough , they started feeling .
so , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy of the difficult situation , they have orginiell and colorful , but somehow it gives them a narrow distinction of narrow down the past as the real world , meaning our world , is beyond .
but i remember the lights in the oil chain at the malaysia coast of the coast coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the inscript of the first aprock was given one of the men on the platform .
they knew that every year about 75,000 gorania , their land left , to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to make , and i think of all the people i wanted to make a hand in life , and i think of all the fences i wanted to do , all the experiences i wanted to do , and never did .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody being fed up for him when he &apos;s at the heart , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the lamb bias when he &apos;s covered by one meter of ice .
i wanted to go back to a routine and to the comfort of a terrorist of a unknown journalist , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who kept off every of your day like 20 years by 20 years by spending each of their day and their day , and they would have slept in the same bed .
it &apos;s the friday , friday . get get down on friday . anyone &apos;s poised to be the sc, etc . friday , friday . friday down on friday . you &apos;re not thinking we &apos;d want to make this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the religious of the opinion that i thought was going to be able to get a way to get the foreign investment to get to the people and build this town for many years .
i was able to paint with other objects , she was running and ran , and she didn &apos;t run and ran , but she didn &apos;t think it would go on the house , and she said it would go more about land , and she said it would go more about land , and she said it would go more about land .
he went with high speed when he suddenly hear a little patch of melody , like it &apos;s a preora of views , like it &apos;s often in inspiration , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s a mucily . he can &apos;t make it .
fathers were extremely sensitive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we could make more mothers in this concept , we &apos;ll make more concept of a concept , not just how to protect but we can do it for each other .
we don &apos;t have the situation to be in iran in the case where a man who is attracted to other men , is to be punished by death , unless he &apos;s to stay in his life , unless he &apos;s to stay alive .
it &apos;s a really nice thing to do with this , so agriculture does , it does , biogas , stroke on a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , so that a farmer can spend about five hundred dollars in favelas , and then you &apos;ll wait to grow chickens and breast vegetables and fish and fish and fish and fish .
but the process and the heavy persistence of adapting around it was fire when he was having a trouble , where he was not setting up a trouble , and he got behind it where he was going from a trouble , and he realized that it had no processed , improvising thing .
and the reason that i saw it on a normal chart , where , say , this is the years , so , you know , this is the years , so this is a kind of a way of the kind , and this is a single-scale scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you , and then the graph is a one-bit scale of the technology that i want to suggest with you
now , not exactly what i hoped was what i hoped was , i went up and the stairs went up , the &quot; real &quot; firewar , &quot; over the top , &quot; the real firefighters , over the top , &quot; get a pair of shoes .
i &apos;ve read a friend of mine to the daughter , and i had to laugh at once , it was as ridiculed , but i just got to talk to &quot; stand and not talk about that , and i could stop talking about it , and i could stop reading and do it at all after that overfolded vigse .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk , they hold talks . they tell people that they should stop saying that we should stop saying that we should have been to deal with that for the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that recently came out of the market , is something like this , the choice of the people who had been very strong about the choices , it &apos;s a program called harvard offered it at harvard .
you know , as a nuder , the moses shaped the hammer and he threw it on moses -- actually , &quot; miss vijacnon parli ? why do you still take a little spot in the surface of -- and said , &quot; miss mendganchanli ? &quot;
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of wealth with you to play new elements -- like the testicles and also the game of both reason and promotes -- while at the same time , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
i tried to do this in my lab back to a little bit , and then i would have been on my perspective of hand equipment on ebay and bought some of the d.an analysis , and i took a little bit of a analysis , so that &apos;s the one that &apos;s like the d.ya fingerprinting maff-print .
i could only change any exercise of potential in infinitely many cases -- in different colors -- that you know , to build my leg muscles , and i &apos;ve misunderstood this chorer , and i &apos;ve misunderstood this chorer than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
this is when you focus a laser beam on one in the room , then you can put little particles into the air or in the liquid , and then in the liquid , which is so , you know , it &apos;s there , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s like this kind of drawing official jet .
bill gates : to get the simulation at a supercomputer , all the major scientists , what we did , we need a few hundred million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , we need a few tens of millions of million .
there are some grade projects that are creating this on 60 percent -- 80 percent level of level , but it will get a very difficult commission to get it , and it will be very hard to get a deal for the burden of co2 for the carbon capacity , it &apos;s a big challenge .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 percent and to nine percent of renewable and then there &apos;s this whole , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which is going to be going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work , you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to work for you .
so this really works in academic journals , and we thought , well , we could maybe go right , and we thought , well , we might also turn the heck , then we could have a webcam , which is removling , the lens goes , it &apos;s a microscope that &apos;s spread around top of four hundred .
in my view of the medical cultural belief and journalism , i have created a personal medical study on medical error and wrong treatments to make everything possible to me for one of my first paper , white divers , black types , and i wrote to learn .
see this amazing demonstrations : voodoo conakacbiodiversity in a transtate of the rest of the sun , the very glowing of coal , has an amazing visualization of the mind to influence the body so that it holds when it gets into a state of extreme arousal .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a problem , and how can you do that better or how you can do that better .
and where you see it , what we really wanted to achieve , what we really wanted to achieve , and how sad we were , we are at all the earth , you can see that we are at all the earth , you can see that , for example , the amount of content is a program , to 20 km you can see a program neutral to 20 .
it would be great if we could make this tragedy of normal versus another , or the strength to actually formulate it even a bit more dangerous , and that can be put a little bit more dangerous to society , and thereby invite them to bring their whole special and valuable value to society .
in this image , i have a bush as a center of branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the species of life have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has survived ; it has its environment , and it &apos;s strength .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to narrow down , and the more important opportunities are going to be going down , you know , there &apos;s a rise in sales ; it &apos;s going to increase the cost of the road ; it &apos;s going to increase the cost of making &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement in decision-making that is in the decision-making improvement .
whenever we think of a burtting and landscape landscape , we can either runsaseberg and the old scaffolding of the blind wild , which is in his slideshow of a farusiical thought , or the other curoreauath , which is the kind of a priciical thought , or saying these people are more with nature , and we say these people are connected to nature , as we do .
people at the back or the one that eventually came up in the video , saying , &quot; well , that looks quite impressive , but if it were real , but if it were real , it would be a hole and there really , if it were really real , it would have a hole and there it is when it really were , it would bleed . &quot;
well , i like a little extreme , you know , in the way little appetite i have on the stocklets of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question , why do we put a real question on it , which we put in it ?
that &apos;s at first that would be a little bit more sketble , so i &apos;ll just make it work if we &apos;re going to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we have to do things online for at least 21 hours a week .
but there was only one company , an agency service , helping us -- and also because i had to do john bond and richard kirshanti for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to deal with my team and go straight with my team .
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- to avoid -- to avoid the ones where they don &apos;t know , they &apos;re afraid of being afraid , and that they will be the welcome , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a skill dog .
but we don &apos;t even miss when we hear someone like this , because we know that kind of argument as we know , and so we &apos;ve kind of embraced the perception of this as long as we know , and we &apos;ve embraced the perception of creativity , and that &apos;s sort of the way that art -- at the end -- always leads to the sea .
and then came from the diy yourself , the founder of the founder , and i said , &quot; well , we have to get to see real meetings , also , and then i &apos;ve experimented with two events , and then i &apos;ve experimented with two events , one in london , and then i have a two-and-a-10 , and a few minutes later , and a little , and a little 10 , and a few , a few minutes later , and a little , and a few minutes later , and a little , and a little , and a little , and a camfrancisco .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i &apos;ve all figured this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what , you know , the psychological present is about about three seconds . in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
and what we did was actually actually sort of using a new kind of network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and the basic information from this network that &apos;s already collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
so cloud computing , something which my friends at autodesk are , tidying up with computing computing and networks , robots , 3d medicine , robots , the 3d technology that allows us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , meases , we name , digital medicine , nano materials .
they believed that a genius of genius was that it was literally a kind of magic thing that was believed literally in the walls of an artistic window -- something like dobby , the house 11 -- the coming -- the one that came out and the work would be made of the work .
a group of ankara i met a few times ago , which is a student group who would like to make the public more interested on what was going to learn in college , and they have to explain how to do so on a lot of new action and people tried to explain what d.esa is .
and the wright with that premise with this premise , which is , for example , brian depa in england , trying to bring a minimal settlement set , then he took a vad-shaped knee , a heat plate , and , yes , so clean , so you have bacteria and work .
but what happened is , 17 trillion dollarmates were ready to dispent on this control that would do with somebody doing business with somebody who would want to do so much of sam and play the stories that we didn &apos;t otherwise have predicted -- stories that don &apos;t usually want to support .
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines , and i &apos;m going to show you 400 papers , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 papers , and you &apos;re going to show you 400 papers , you think i &apos;ve given you more selection and a better experience of having given you the past 400 .
so by using color , contrast and contrast to the edges , photographic comstaples add the way that field deep , dedadized , colors and disorders , and eliminate the boundaries between the various images and just look like a single photograph , although it can contain a picture of all the levels and then take a picture of it , although it can contain all hundreds of levels .
and that &apos;s when you all miss your feelings about politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we really miss , the government we really revolted about , the government in the core of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; which we can do in common , in the words
there are the bush dssgoes in my local supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive oodges , and 12 / kbalivates that they could buy to create a large number of their salad salings , which is unlikely , no of the shores of the back .
i think a significant -- not the only thing , but a significant jumanine to that explosion of depression , and also , with god , is that people have experienced the disapmises , because , when they need to explain their standards , it would be their fault .
i had written this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the measuring pole in the visual effects and computer-generated effects in a whole new configuration , with a realist human , with a realist human being , and the main figures were required , and the main figures were supposed to be all cg , and the world should be cg .
my colleague at mit , assaf biffman , could you even think a lot more about this and tell the other wonderful things you can perceive with , tell you , but i want to talk to you about the second one that we thought about and that &apos;s driving our environment .
but we wanted to go a lot more . we wanted to build a whole virus of virus , and it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code , and we thought we could build it in castapes , the size of the virus we could do with the size of the living , to know what the individual components are in a living cell .
i &apos;m probably one of the nice guys , still , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m probably in the generation of the generation , which has been picked up for this bad wildity of this bad , severe , that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to call , i think , kit .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication -- they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people who each human being uses on average , and the coal , which is a unit of energy .
you know ? i think a mere person is to allow him to think or she &apos;s or as she &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis , like the pelvis , the essence and the source of all the , creative , unheard mystery , is a little too good for you to migrate to a fractal , human mind .
and it was really , really , really , really , really , really , in place , just like this , just shown a picture where i was wondering , and i was going to just get a picture of where i was wondering after 10 years , a thousand photography , in the collective of all , of course , whether that &apos;s really supposed to be the great thing .
this was the real form of a déjv vu i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i ever get to point out to a corner of a corner , i always knew what exactly would be in the light of the vehicle , because i was going to run on a film post .
we are at the verge of the amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i think we need to go back and take it back to the enlightenment to find a time in which we have to go back to more front than now .
and if you were to do another holiday vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between two types of self and you have to think about how they &apos;re going to decide that conflict and that &apos;s really not at all , because if you think of memory , you might have a different answer . and if you think of memory , you might get a different answer .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your urban society center , like our fellow scott silmeger is part of the program -- indeed , they all do -- you will all -- you will see that -- you will see that the people , the government of many different problems , they say that a marmaral rat is in their house .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or in some engineering , but rather than an era where we were in a fixed condition , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth are either active or passively .
what i first first show you is the basic work , is the basic work , a new technology that we have as part of a revoluting , just a year , which we have , as part of a revoluting , which is just a year of a revoluded technology .
the computer curves algorithms have both holding pictures together using the real space , allowing them to put the real space in which these things that all are available near the grassroots rockies in the canadian rockies , are indicated there are elements of stabilized slides or pair of things , and these things were all available to each other .
interesting , interesting grade , as the mopp-southern jungle , they brought this practice with this -- the adoption language changed in the course of the centuries of lenallah , allah , ollah , which you still can still fight and cherlate with costiting and talk dancers .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , two gut reflective , had two different surgeons , and they would decide which to vote , then the one chooses choosing that &apos;s a little bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s selected .
so we have a situation , where , as we continue to further our science , we must acknowledge that those categories that we had chosen to have the stable anatomical categories that made very simple evidence of self-identity , which made very simple motivation than we &apos;ve imagined .
and when these people came and see who &apos;s the best set of compliry in the world , this was not a mit professor , didn &apos;t , was there any caltic student , it was a man from england , the first building of the business in a reha clinic , and the best set of retomtomed in the world .
no biologist would claim that 50 percent or more of all kinds of extinction are extinct before extinction , because it just wasn &apos;t true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenario , the apocalyptic scenario , we can hardly tell us about the area of the cultural diversity .
while i was looking for models in the past year , for the past year , i was looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see if they were going to help to deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
and then , if you &apos;re in part of the software we just saw , we will also understand why nine and nine percent of our software today are kind of doing this little bit of things that &apos;s going to be very suitable or not to reproduce , even more intuitive than the traditional software .
the first thing that you &apos;re going to be as a kid , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what &apos;s causing what distinguishes them , right ? and the weight of whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the killing .
and the way from using wietment is the idea that success or happiness depended on a challenge , not having a challenge with being able to get into the experience of being an associated experience , and as if my life would be so successful , it &apos;s as though i could have a handle with a prosthetic , or whatever people do , with my disability .
and from a conversation that morning , by dean , you yourself , one of the innovators of the r tedu yourself , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his use of his personal logy , the &quot; slinged , &quot; and the many of you , and it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator gray in the student .
if i was full of a room full of colleagues and told them to tell their immediate support and tell them what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t get the end of the second story ever before it really favors anyone to change a joke , and they would forget the topic .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral in dame dame , which was just focused in the computer with images of flickr , giving them not-based dame in a flickr and on the university and so on and on and on , and each one of these newbers sthorking represents a picture that was discovered as this model .
and if i &apos;m now wearing that , like i &apos;m cross-plying through the record , which is , as a choice , it &apos;s big to me , as a choice , which is coming up to me , and i can send it to the details , and yes , it &apos;s called , i can send it to it , or you can shop or shop or shop and shop and shop on .
we also have one of these foreign fighters in the same size as it &apos;s there , put in the hall to actually put the full form of dynamic behaviors from this web , so in the middle , it looks like the diesel , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole shuw that we simulate .
i was afraid , not mine , but i was afraid i could lose him , he could destroy himself , and i could destroy him with the violin , if i started to talk about pintics and arpedogic and some exciting art in didagy and some exciting forms of diy .
if i want to share with you today an issue today , it &apos;s the whole story that we consume is greater than the sum of the parts , and so rather than thinking about information flow , i want you to think about how we can use information to make information that otherwise we would see how to use information that otherwise we would see that otherwise it would be , ok , and we &apos;re not going to be seen that otherwise would be not seen .
but my dream here is , if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the skeptics are coming , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not going to be able to use it , it &apos;s not going to be the co2 , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
now , i &apos;d like to take a example of somebody who had a question and a request meeting , one of my lectures , who gave a story , and it was absolutely glorious music , and he was absolutely affected , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and he was in the end of the recording there was a terrible division of crime .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering was the draaden-prize prize for francis arnold and wilaitus , major scientists who have developed independently techniques that have developed the natural process of evolution to work and to make more kinds of protein in an more efficient way -- which frances call a direct evolution .
so in a study i did with shlomo benartzi , and alessandro , made us , we made a study with people who worked on the people -- employees that were all working on the appropriate plan for their retirement plan .
and then they came back to montyony , and she came back to montounce rejeke , where they had two of their oldest friends , never carr , who &apos;d been organized for the montder , never carking , who &apos;s organized the montder bus , and the name of virginia , which was a white , called of child g. r , the name of the husband .
these people are online to the people , but they &apos;ve been having it illegal by using trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do our online banking , or even as we do our online banking , or even we do keyloggers that &apos;ve collected our credit information information to the input , while we &apos;re running online online .
you know , one of the great geniuses of traveling , and one of the most chersts of the race of the academy of tests , with the people who can still live with the old days , which is the time that they can &apos;t even feel the old days , which is the more the same thing that they &apos;re taste in the wind , they &apos;re wiping out the plants .
this idea kept me through the writing of the morning of &quot; othards , camping , love . i fell in one of these drawn , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start to think that there &apos;s a disaster , this will be the worst book ever written .
now nowadays , if you want to win a race , it &apos;s actually something like this -- something like this -- something that &apos;s displayed in real time , some thousands of sensors that are tracking information from the car , and then transfer it and then use that , and then use that , and then use things in real time while information is being mapped .
you all know about healthy shame if you give a mystery to best friend &apos;s worth , but if this one gets stuck in a place , and then you get caught with the best friend of being a terrible argument , and leads you to be a terrible argument ever to make sure .
i &apos;m going to suggest to you all , the book book , reading the movie , will look at the movie so you can understand not just the wonderful connectedness that have been formed between these two men , but also how music was allowed to get the instrument , silying away away from the street .
and that made me to another human being , as my friends under the kwakil , believing that these forests of the city of hukuk and the boboals are the cannious ghosts , the shoniy-quiky ghoction , the shoniian ghoction , the shopian spirits , the middle of the world , the spirits they would be involved in .
and so i ended up with the people who were interested in space and with nasa and at nasa &apos;s expertise , and to be able to sit at the real space table and to do real space delivery , and you drive our 3d space station , go to russia , go to the international space station and take our 3d camera system .
and of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. i , so i do it , i do it , i &apos;m making it , i think , the one i don &apos;t want to do with the most richest , the most richest of five-year-old in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually made a new and subtle experience .
i mean , some happy people and companies , stand and non-, got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never be again again -- the namnamnamces that were going to be in the moment that it was actually going to be a whole title , not a lot of the hint of what the subject was supposed to be .
bruce brown , a known design researcher at the brighton university , is so far left to say that this mass of mass , he argues the book , and the image , not the tv , the internet and so on , and so on , and the internet , the internet and so on , and so on , that we have transformed up to virtual openness .
bg : well , we haven &apos;t set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting legal rules for everything that is called nuclear , the nuclear bubble , and there &apos;s been a lot of interest , and the people of the companies have been in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve got to hit the energy of the energy .
human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are asking me to tell me how to go through wiabturnand and i &apos;m always going to figure out something : this sentence has never been suspicious of me and i think i understand why .
in the early age of years , i received a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to go to haiti and to infillitate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength and the sound of the venvaliic societies and the poison that was used to make zombies , make sure .
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , is a shift in the burden of responsibility for a person &apos;s decision , &quot; one thing that &apos;s not known , but the reality is a shift in the world &apos;s behalf , and is probably ill , and is not going to make a decision -- namces of the patient .
and so there are different things , but the beauty of this is that a direct molecule has a million times as much energy as it does , say a carbon-molecule molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the cost , the footprint and the costs , it plays the impact , the effect of the country and other things , almost in a single league .
we cleaned the chromosome a microspecies . in short , these are both as one from one way from human beings and mice , we put some extra genes to destroy people and mice , we put some extra genes to destroy the dna , we measured it with enzymes to destroy the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;ll be very amazing in the one cell -- and they &apos;ll be very amazing to destroy our very narrow graphic here .
i had a particular encounter that i met that was the extraordinary american academy in ruth stone , who now is about 90 , but their entire life was 16 , but she was looking at me in the field of being in the favela , and she said she was growing up in the favela , and she said she could feel her , and listen to a poem about the landscape on her .
and they have two surgeries that were picked up , and they said , &quot; well , we do a simpler , simpler , and we just got out of open-source source , so , free , that &apos;s free , and then they &apos;re just going out of open source , and then they &apos;re the cheapest undergraduates of these drugs in the continent .
if a no one has said that the jeopsia zip , which has a completely crushed -- i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , i &apos;ve been hard to think of myself , i had a hard time of my father &apos;s worth , because all of my father my father spoke to him , you have disforced the money on the window .
many of you will know the story , because from stealing &apos;s articles on later , a book that was repeated , with robert rosling , and jamie gen-x , who had been a sopearly , the double abster , who had been performed at juilli-stor-dote and jamie gen-fer-in , who was actually finished in the juararhip wedding .
and so the idea of now , now , if you have all kinds of problems in invest , in something you have , you have something that &apos;s not so clear , and is that the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily have the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that are going to look at the point and there are people in the rich world who are looking at the moment and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
a few years ago , the scientists at the scientists juinya awarded for his research in he took a adult skin , an fibrotomatic , and through manipulation of only four genes , the cell induced inducted , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell induced capable of being able to become any cell in your body .
so i went home and i ate dinner with my wife and told her , &quot; well , wait a minute , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use with everything , and we thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , if there &apos;s this technology that you can do to control the way that he can make a laser taxes , that &apos;s a great thing . &quot;
i was planning to go with a young colleague 6,000 miles from namedu in west china , in lenga , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of the people who have been murdered by the cacaes of the cacada that were murdered in rubble and the caldes .
and now we &apos;re going to move towards biology , and here i want to , this is the metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a information science , because the d.ley code is an abstract code , because it &apos;s the d.i code , because it &apos;s important , it &apos;s not just cyber .
and if you look down at the bottom here , you see the lab , so there &apos;s such a garage garage with so much possible , so there &apos;s a pair of garage with it , which has a group of work with the university of college that &apos;s in place and pretty successfully , i want to cut a group on it .
and in order to show the dimensions , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , which for cars , computers , cell lights , pockmles , for everything , and i &apos;ve found that i have the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , which is the world that uses the world , less than 10 minutes of the coverage of that matter .
and that would be their answer to the bv lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other targets of suffering , the reduction of poverty , the other goals of that , that are suffering malaria , and so on , it &apos;s a dumb waste of resources , to invest in malaria , while there are better things we can do .
and yet , here in this country , in the old southern 60s , we &apos;re trying to see people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted , the death of being sentencing at death , 11 times higher when the victim is white and the victims knows -- in the same states , the nation &apos;s bodies .
